            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Expect to hear from all Sides, that ſuch Controverſies as theſe, at this time a day, are very inopportune and Ill adviſed; I confeſs we have as much reaſon to value our preſent Eaſe and Quiet as any People in the World, and to avoid every thing that may diſturb or indanger it: And we have not ſo abandon'd the Principles of Self-preſervation, as willingly to expoſe our ſelves to repeated Severities.</p>
            <p>And if I had not ſome Cauſe to believe that our ſilent diſregard of the Abuſes put upon us, will be made (by Innuendo's) a Confeſſion of Guilt, and will harden and encourage our Adverſaries againſt us, I would have took no notice of the Citizen's Reply, but have left him and his Learned Cabal, to the ſweet Delights of a fancied Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>I know we may ſafely appeal, from his ſordid Calumnies, to the juſter Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, of the ſobereſt and wiſeſt of the Epiſcopal Perſwaſion, who have been full as ſevere in the Cenſure of his Pamphlets, as is neceſſary for us to be; but I am alſo aſſured, there are too many in this emancipated Age, that are paſſionately fond of any thing that throws dirt upon Diſſenters, and true or falſe, ſence or nonſence, it is all one to them; whoſe inſatiable Luſts have left them neither Time nor Capacity to ſearch into the true ſtate and merits of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>I wonder upon what Inducement, this Gentleman ſhould take upon him to quarrel with Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Enquiry, unleſs it were that he might make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Favourite of ſuch a Generation of Men; or that his Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had obliged him to do Pennance in thoſe Sheets; I know not what could have been writ, more fair and inoffenſive, than that Book; Schiſm was the Word, that had animated Men with a ſtrange, Blind Zeal, againſt all thoſe upon whom their Leading Men had fixed the mark; and it was given out with ſo much Induſtry, as if it had been the <hi>Shibboleth</hi> of the Party, reſerved for ſome ſpecial Service againſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Seaſon.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93151:3"/>
            <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> kindly endeavoured to undeceive them, and by enquiring into the Quality of thoſe Actions, upon which this Sin is charged in Scripture to diſcover its true formal Nature, that Men might not fight in the dark, and build vaſt and endleſs Controverſies upon a ſingle Word, and that too not rightly underſtood.</p>
            <p>He obſerves that the word Schiſm is not uſed in Scripture in any ſence applicable to the preſent Caſe, ſave only three times in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> thoſe places he has particularly examined. He ſhews that thoſe Schiſmatical <hi>Corinthians</hi> met in the ſame place ſtill, but contending with one another, about ſome leſſer matters to the breach of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Love, and Mutual Alienation of their Affections, fell into the Sin there called Schiſm;
<note place="margin">Enquiry, <hi>p.</hi> 9.</note> concluding from hence, that the formal Nature of this Sin conſiſts not in Separation of Communion, but in the Violation of that Love and Charity there ought to be amongst Chriſtians; Acknowledging nevertheleſs, that many Overt Actions may be, and are Schiſmatical, as they proceed from this Uncharitableneſs; and he mentions ſuch as theſe, <hi>Judging and Condemning one another about the Circumſtantials of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; reproaching and reviling each other; making, approving, and executing Penal Laws, about ſuch things; and Separation from Communion with thoſe we have joyn'd our ſelves to without cauſe; that is, (as he explains it) without regard had to any thing amiſs in the Church we ſeparate from, or any thing better in that we joyn our ſelves to, which he calls Separation for Separation's ſake;</hi> This is Schiſm, not barely becauſe Separation, but becauſe animated by that Uncharitableneſs and Diſaffection, which in Scripture is known by the Name of Schiſm.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman, could not digeſt a Notion ſo far different from what he had imbib'd;
<note place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 2.</note> but tells us, Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Book had not much more of Schiſm than of the Philoſopher's Stone in it: He was loth ſo heavy a Charge ſhould lye againſt Uncharitableneſs, which being a main Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in his own Conſtitution, muſt be more ſoftly and tenderly handled, he thinks it more Prudent to lay the Fault ſo, as he may bear the leaſt ſhare of it himſelf;
<note place="margin">Arch-Rebel, <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> and therefore boldly affirms, that Diverſity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is the <hi>Ratio formalis</hi> of Schiſm; and more than that, ſays he, has proved it to be ſo.</p>
            <p>The Author of the Vindication juſtly blam'd him, for ſo raſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident an Aſſertion, as giving the Lye to the Word of God, which Charges the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with the Guilt of Schiſm, when there was no ſuch diverſity of Communion; and can there be a Schiſm where that is wanting, which he calls the true formal Nature of Schiſm? Can a thing exist without its Eſſential Form? To this, the Gentleman replies, <q>Shall a Cut in the Arm be truly Schiſm, and not the ſeparating the Arm from the Body? If <hi>Paul</hi> condemned the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of Schiſm, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring one Miniſter before another,</q> Shall that far greater Crime of
<pb facs="tcp:93151:3"/>ſeparating from them, be excluded from Schiſm? This Gentleman is a topping Accuſer.</p>
            <p>But we cannot Complement this Gentleman ſo far as to call him a Topping Defendant; For the Queſtion was not, Whether there may not be a Separation that is really Schiſmatical, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> granted that; But whether Separation be the very Eſſence and formal Nature of Schiſm? If ſo, then there can be no Schiſm without ſuch Separation; which is falſe, as in the Caſe of the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> nor any Separation without Schiſm, which is equally falſe; for in many caſes we may be obliged in Duty to ſeparate: His Compariſon of Cutting the Arm from the Body is like it ſelf, Lame and Defective; for ſometimes ſuch a Sciſſure may be neceſſary to keep the Body from periſhing: In ſhort, if Separation be needleſs, it is ſinful; if Uncharitable, it is Schiſmatical; if neither need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nor Uncharitable, it is a Duty; And let it be obſerved by the way, that in this Reply, the Gentleman acknowledges the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were guilty of Schiſm, though they did not Separate; when before he told us, he had proved that the <hi>Ratio formalis</hi> of Schiſm, conſiſts in Separation, let him reconcile theſe things at his leiſure.</p>
            <p>He thinks if ſuch Uncharitableneſs be Schiſm, it must follow, <hi>à mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nori ad majus,</hi> diverſity of Communion is much more ſo; but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning is not good, for Uncharitableneſs can in no caſe be lawful, but Separation may: He himſelf acknowledges, that if any of their terms of Communion be ſinful, our Separation is juſtifiable; and yet even in that caſe, Uncharitableneſs would be a Sin.</p>
            <p>If this Gentleman muſt needs let the World ſee his Talent in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, he ſhould have taken up the true Queſtion, as it was laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, VVhat is that which the Scripture calls Schiſm? and ſhould have proved in all thoſe Inſtances, where mention is made of it, that there was not only Alienation of Affection, but diverſity of Communion; and when he had done this, it had been time enough to have boaſted, that he had anſwered Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Enquiry, till then his Labour is impertinent, and his Triumphs ridiculous.</p>
            <p>But inſtead of obſerving this Proper and Neceſſary Method, which by all the Laws of Argument he was bound to, he ranges from the Point, and Chimes upon thoſe <hi>decantate</hi> terms, Church, Unity, Communion, Obedience, Succeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is wonderfully pleaſed with the melodious Sound of words he does not underſtand; for though he ſhould from theſe Topicks, prove the Practice of Diſſenters to be ſinful, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove it to be that Sin which in Scripture is called Schiſm, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he can diſcover in it, that Uncharitableneſs, and want of Chriſtian Affection, which is the very thing called by that Name in ſacred Writ.</p>
            <p>This would be ſufficient for the Defence of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Enquiry, without ever entring upon the Lawfulneſs or Fault of Nonconformity; but ſince
<pb facs="tcp:93151:4"/>the Valiant Man has challenged us into that Field of Argument, we have gone along with him into it, and endeavoured to juſtifie our Practice not only from the Crime of Schiſm, but any other of which it has been accuſed, and how far we have ſucceeded in this Affair, is with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible reſpect referred to the Cenſure of the Learned and Moderate of both Perſwaſions.</p>
            <p>The grand Impertinencies expoſed in the Gentleman's firſt Paper, he has endeavoured to defend in the latter; but through the Common Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of a Man that meddles with what he does not underſtand, he is more bewildred and confounded than before; and indeed of all things that ever ſet up for a Defence of ſo Learned a Party as the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, I never ſaw any thing comparable to this, for Stile and Argument, unleſs it were the famous Works of Mrs. <hi>Eleanor James,</hi> to which this Gentleman's Reply bears ſuch a marvellous reſemblance, that a man would almoſt conclude it to be the iſſue of ſome Friendly Conference betwixt our Citizen, and that renowned Heroine.</p>
            <p>I wonder why he ſhould be ſo much diſturbed, that the Vindicator has concealed his Name, eſpecially when he did not think fit to diſcover his own; for <hi>T. W.</hi> Citizen of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> is a Cypher ſo general, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us to conjecture, and common fame, and leaves him room to eſcape, if any ſuch danger ſhould happen, as he portends concerning his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but what great matter is it, who is meant by <hi>T. W.</hi> or what that mans name is, that has adventured to encounter him; it is not names, but things, that we have to examine; and yet by his little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible menaces, it is very apparent, that he would gladly betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to their former way of Confuting Diſſenters, as that which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found to be the moſt eaſie and effectual.</p>
            <p>He Triumphs in the Effects of his former Paper, one of which was, few believed but that it was done by ſome Clergy-man, who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him to Print it in his Name; That is to ſay, they thought it beyond the longth of <hi>T. W.</hi> to write ſuch a Book; a ſhrewd ſign, that his Neighbours have no great Opinion of his Abilities, if they thought ſuch ſtuff was above him; but as his Name is capable of giving little Reputation to another mans work, ſo I dare ſay no Clergy man in <hi>Cheſter</hi> will grudge him the Honour of his own.</p>
            <p>He would not be thought, to have acted beneath himſelf in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and therefore he magnifies the Stature of his Adverſary, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Vindicator into a Ship, and by all means, it muſt be one of the firſt Rate, that was choſen to Attack and Fire all its Guns, at his mighty Self, ſo happy a thing it is to have Gazetts and News Letters always at hand, where a man can never fail of being furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with Admirable Metaphors, but (if we muſt needs ſpeak in ſuch Bombardick Language) though the Vindicator was ſize enough, for
<pb facs="tcp:93151:4"/>the Service aſſigned him, yet there was no need of chuſing a Man of War of the firſt Rate, to engage a diſabled Frigat,
<note place="margin">Venus arta Mari.</note> whoſe Maſt and Tackling, had ſuffered miſerably in ſome hot Sea-fights heretofore.</p>
            <p>But 'tis no part of my deſign, to vye with him in his Bantering Dialect, I ſhall therefore apply my ſelf in good earneſt, to the matter in Hand, and in the Remainder of this Preface, defend ſome leſſer Paſſages in the Vindication, which this Gentleman either does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or will not ſeem to do ſo, and afterwards proceed to the more material parts of the Controverſie.</p>
            <p>In his firſt Paper he pretends to tell us, of the Origination and firſt Exiſtence of the Church, which he dates only from the time of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, mentioned <hi>Acts 2.</hi> The Vindicator thought there was Reaſon to find fault with that Account of the Matter, not only becauſe it excludes the Angels, which but a few Lines before, this Gentleman had told us, were members of the Church, but eſpecially, becauſe it ſhuts out the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church, as it ſtood in Old Teſtament Times; but he has a Salvo ready ſuch as it is, and he that can content himſelf with ſuch a one will never be at want, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </q> But if I miſtake not, he promiſed to ſhew us, when the Church had its firſt Exiſtence, not when it acquired a new Title; it's an odd way of arguing, The Church was firſt called Catholick at Pentecoſt, therefore it had its firſt Exiſtence then, a miſerable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and yet as good as the Antecedent, for it is not true that the Church was called Catholick at that time, nor do we find it once ſo called in all the Scripture that I know of (and the Wall of Partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was broken down at Chriſts Death, when the Vail of the Temple was rent in ſunder) and if in ſpight of all Reaſon the Exiſtence of a Church muſt needs commence with its acqueſt of a new Title, he muſt ſtill fix his Epocha much lower; and yet I know not, why the Name Catholick, may not (if men pleaſe) be attributed to the Jewiſh Church, which was before its Apoſtacy the whole, and the true Viſible Church of God upon Earth.</p>
            <p>The Vindicator told him, nothing could be proved from the bare Name of Biſhops in Scripture-times, to favour our Engliſh Prelacy, till the Power of thoſe Biſhops, the Extent of their Dioceſes, the Quality of their Under-Officers, the Modes of their Worſhip, and Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, be proved to be the ſame with ours, or liable to the ſame Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; To this the Gentleman replies, <q>
                  <hi>I cannot underſtand this laſt Sentence</hi> (or liable to the ſame Exceptions,) <hi>unleſs he would make the Primitive Church liable to the ſame Exceptions;</hi>
               </q> But I hope we are not to be blamed, for the dullneſs of his underſtanding; The Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is Plain and Pertinent, He knows very well what Exceptions we
<pb facs="tcp:93151:5"/>make, againſt the Power of our Engliſh Prelates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if he can prove that the ſame Objections lye againſt the Primitive Epiſcopacy, he ſhews thereby that they are frivolous and unjuſt, and throws them out of doors, as militating againſt Scripture Biſhops as well as ours; one would have thought the meaneſt Citizen in <hi>Cheſter,</hi> might have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this, but it will never be better, when men take upon them to be Authors, in ſpight of Nature and Education.</p>
            <p>He condemns the Vindicator, as having no regard to Eccleſiaſtical An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, for ſpeaking of Scripture Rules, before they were written, this lets us ſee, What Mercy we may expect from him, when we ſtand in need of it: We will endeavour therefore to be as little beholden to him as we can; and as to this matter, a few Words will evince, that his Reflection is very unjuſt.</p>
            <p>In his former Paper,
<note place="margin">Arch-Rebel, <hi>p.</hi> 2.</note> ſpeaking of the Progreſs of the Goſpel, and planting the ſeven Aſian Churches, in St. <hi>Johns</hi> time, he adds, <hi>Though there was a Multiplication of Churches, yet no Variation;</hi> here the Vindicator enquired; <hi>What does he mean in ſaying there was no Variation? Was there no variety at all in any Circumſtance of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that's</hi> gratis dictum? <hi>if he means there was no Variation from Scripture Rules, (though we are afraid that will ſcarce hold yet) we wiſh it had been ſo ſtill.</hi> Now it ſeems the Vindicators Errour was, he ſpoke of Scripture Rules in the Apoſtolical Age, and they were not then written; No? That's ſomething ſtrange, were not the Goſpels and Epiſtles writ by Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, during the time of their Lives? No Legend that ever I heard of, tells us of their riſing from the dead, and writing to the Churches; And if they writ their Epiſtles, containing Rules for Divine Worſhip, why may not thoſe be called Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rules: What if they were not Collected as ſoon as they were writ, were they not therefore both Scripture, and Authoritative? And yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Learned Men think the Canon of Scripture was collected in St. <hi>Johns</hi> time, and that this awful Sanction, <hi>If any ſhall add to theſe things, God will add unto him the Plagues that are written in this Book,</hi> &amp;c. Refers not only to the Apocalypſe, but to the whole Canon, and ſtands like the Cherub with a flaming Sword to Guard the Tree of Life, and if this Gentleman be for Scripture Rules, that were not written in the Time of the Apoſtles, I deſpair of ever coming to an agreement with him.</p>
            <p>And it is certain, there is a very material difference betwixt us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Rule and Standard of Controverſie, which muſt be firſt adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before we can well proceed any further, for if we take different Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, we ſhall certainly give a very different account.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> deſirous to find out the true Notion of Schiſm, takes for his Rule, all thoſe places in the New Teſtament, where that Word is found;
<pb facs="tcp:93151:5"/>This the Gentleman is offended at, and tells him, <q>If he had enquired into the ninth Article of the Apoſtles Creed, then he had found out the true Standard of this Controverſie;</q> And the Vindicator thought, there was more Reaſon to be offended with him, for declining the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Scripture, as the ſtandard of Faith and Practice, this he cenſured as an affront to Scripture, and common Senſe too, for when the Authority of that Creed depends ſolely upon its agreement with Scripture, how ſenceleſs a thing is it, to make that a truer Standard than Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whoſe Truth and meaning is to be derived purely from it? What defence now will the Citizen make? As good as he can afford no doubt; He charges the Vindicator with ſaying, that an Article of Faith, is an affront to Scripture and Common Sence, which is as falſe as any thing in the World, we appeal to the Readers Eyes, and deſire no other favour, but that he Read true.</p>
            <p>To bring himſelf off, he acknowledges, <q>That the Scripture indeed is the trueſt touch-ſtone of Sin and Duty, but he adds, whoever he be that expounds the Holy Scripture, in Contradiction to an Article of the Creed, muſt needs err; and we are aſſured of the Errour, by that Article it contradicts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Should we grant this to be good Sence and Divinity, yet it will not ſerve his turn; for then he ſhould not have accuſed Mr. <hi>H.</hi> of taking a wrong Standard, but have proved, that he made an Erroneous Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the true One to his Caſe, which are two different things; a man may take a true meaſure, and yet miſtake in meaſuring a thing by it, but to tell him in the former Paper, of not finding out the true ſtandard, and to think to come off in this, by blaming his Expoſition of it, is a very ſorry ſhift, which his Ignorance, or Inadvertency has forced him upon.</p>
            <p>And yet we muſt not let him go, without further Examination about this matter, for it is certain he is fallen into a moſt dangerous Errour, making the Compilers of the Apoſtolical and Nicene Creeds, the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Interpreters of Scripture; for ſo he tells us.
<note place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> 
               <hi>We come to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly aſſured, that the Socinian Interpretation of Scripture againſt the Divinity of Chriſt is Falſe, becauſe it contradicts that Article, I believe in Jeſus the onely begotten Son of God, and that in the Nicene Creed, God of God, very God of very God, being of one Subſtance with the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an Opinion, which his own Spiritual Guides, are obliged to chaſtize him for, being ſo contrary to the avowed Principles of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, and to what our Learned Doctors have worthily aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their late Writings againſt the Papiſts, to which I refer him for his better Information, amongſt others, let him conſult the Ingenious Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> in his Preſervative againſt Popery, where having declared that
<pb facs="tcp:93151:6"/>the Proteſtants abide by that,
<note place="margin">Part 1ſt. P. 49.</note> which they ſee plainly proved out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, bids us put this Queſtion, <q>How ſhall we know what is the true ſenſe of Scriptures, and propoſes three ways, either by an Infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, or the unanimous Conſent of the Fathers, or by ſuch humane means as are uſed, to find out the ſenſe of other Books; He rejects the Pretenſions of an Infallible Interpreter, and diſapproves of the Rule of Expounding Scripture by the Conſent of the Fathers, and concludes there is no way left, but to expound it as we do other Writings, by conſidering the Signification, and Propriety of Words, and Phraſes, the Scope and Context of the Place, the Reaſon of things, the Analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Old and New Teſtament, and the like.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Our Citizen has found out that Infallible Interpreter, which the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctor was ignorant of; He is infallibly aſſured of the Divinity of Chriſt, becauſe the Compilers of the Apoſtolical and Nicene Creeds, have ſo Interpreted Scripture; but what if one ſhould ask him, How he is ſure the Doctrines of the Creed are true Expoſitions of Scripture? Either he muſt fall into the Circle, or reſolve his Faith into the Infallibility of the Church, and Compilers of thoſe Creeds; and therein he turns his back upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all the Reformed, in one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and moſt Important Points of Controverſie, the Reſolution of Faith.</p>
            <p>I will not ſuppoſe him ſo ignorant, as to think that the Apoſtles were the Authors of that Creed, that goes under their Name; Biſhop <hi>Pearſon,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Towerſon,</hi> will tell him the contrary, and by the Confeſſion of all Proteſtants, Theſe Creeds are but ſummary Collections of the moſt principal Doctrines of Faith, put into that form by Fallible Men, and are to be received no further, and on no other account, than as they are Conſonant to the Word of God, and therefore were never intended, as a Standard or Rule of Faith, or as an infallible Interpreter of that which is ſo; I wonder how this Gentleman would have been infallibly aſſured of the Divinity of Chriſt, if he had lived before theſe Symbols were extant, I wonder, how he is infallibly aſſured of the true ſence of theſe Creeds? I doubt, he wants one Creed to give an Infallible Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of another, and ſo <hi>ad Infinitum;</hi> but if he ſay, the ſence of theſe Creeds is very plain and obvious to any ordinary Capacity, ſo is the Scripture too in all Fundamental Points, and is ſufficient Aſſurance of the Truth of them, without the joint Security of Ancient Creeds and Churches.</p>
            <p>Whether theſe odd Opinions, are to be imputed to his inconſiderateneſs, of which every Page affords us inſtances enough, or rather to the Happy
<pb facs="tcp:93151:6"/>Illuminations, of his great Rabbi, Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> I will not determine; but the latter is not improbable, if we compare it, with what that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibious Gentleman writes,
<note place="margin">Separation of Churches, <hi>p.</hi> 542.</note> 
               <q>That the Power actually received by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Miniſters muſt not be meaſured by the true Sence of Scriptures, but by that wherein the Ordainers underſtood them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Many other <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fata</hi> of the like Nature, have proceeded from that great Oracle, which would ſcarcely have been encouraged or ſo much as ſuffered in any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church beſides our own, but it was ſufficient to make theſe things paſſable, that they were levelled at the Diſſenters, and ſent them all head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the Pit.</p>
            <p>I think it may not be amiſs to defend the Vindicator from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Malice, againſt the late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which this Gentleman very unfairly ſuggeſts; the Paſſage aimed at, is this, <q>
                  <hi>To ſay, that Biſhops,
<note place="margin">Vindic. <hi>p.</hi> 18.</note> which are ſtated Paſtors in an Organical Church, are the Apoſtles Succeſſors, in their Apoſtolical Power, is deſtructive to their own Notion of Church Government, and would give the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>as great Power in</hi> England, <hi>as the Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>(when there is any.)</hi>
               </q> All the Malice lies in this little Parentheſis, when there is any, and here the Citizen clamours upon him, for reviling Gods High Prieſt,
<note place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 18.</note> and ſpeaking evil of the Ruler of his People; What Apology will the Vindicator now make? Truely, if it was my own Caſe, I would deſire no better, than that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> under the ſame Accuſation, <hi>I wiſt not Brethren, that he was the High Prieſt.</hi> The late Arch-Biſhop, had been deprived by Law, above half a Year before that Vindication was writ, and the Metropolitane See was vacant, a conſiderable time after this was Printed, and yet it was a malicious Reviling of the Ruler of Gods People, to ſay there was none, I will not drive this too far, I hope he can give a better Reaſon for calling the Deprived Prelate the Ruler of Gods People than I can for him; If he was the Ruler ſtill, What becomes of the Authority of thoſe that deprived him? It had been more becoming this Gentleman, to have anſwered that Argument, wherein this Parentheſis had its Place, than by falling foul upon ſo Innocent an Expreſſion, to expoſe thoſe thoughts, which Prudence would have concealed.</p>
            <p>I know not of any thing elſe in his Reply that needs to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, but what will fall under the General Heads of this following Treatiſe; wherein I have attempted (at leaſt) to prove, that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, are not Schiſmatical, or Unlawful, though many of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, were not Ordained by Dioceſan Biſhops, though the Places we meet in be diſtinct from the Pariſh Churches, and the Mode of our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in ſome things different from theirs.</p>

               <p>IT is the obſervation of an Ingenious Gentleman, that the World has never been without ſome extraordinary word, to fill mens mouths, and furniſh out Pamphlets, and by which the Sentiments of men, have been for the moſt part more abſolutely governed, than by the true reaſon of things, for Reaſon concludes nothing, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition; but the other, like a kind of ſpell, captivates and determines mens thoughts, many times beyond the Relief, of the moſt rational and convincing Arguments.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all the Charms of this nature, which take place as the Intereſts and Deſigns of Parties, or poſture of Publick Affairs, vary and direct, I know of none, that has been more unmercifully tortured, and forced to ſpeak things never intended by it, than this of <hi>Unity:</hi> It has been the Motto, and Device, of every Aſcendant Party, in the Militant Church, to frighten the weak and timorous, and chaſtiſe the more reſolute oppoſers of Spiritual Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and Tyranny.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts, for the good Service it has done them, have preferr'd it to be the Seventh Note of their Church, according to the Order in which their great Cardinal has marſhall'd them; and under the Umbrage thereof, have raiſed the greateſt Feuds and Diviſions, that ever infeſted the Chriſtian World. In their moſt bloody Perſecutions, barbarous and funeſt Tragedies, they have ſtill pretended to act by the Commiſſion of Catholick Unity, to advance her Intereſts, and to make her glorious in the World; when in the mean time, Chriſtianity it ſelf has been rendred odious and contemptible,
<note place="margin">Ridente Turce, nec dolente Judaeo.</note> Turks, Jews, and Pagans, have beheld her flames with pleaſure, and warmed themſelves, and ſaid, <hi>Aha, thus we would have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt not be denied, but that Catholick Unity, where it is ſo happy as to be underſtood, acquaints us with ſomething very ſacred and venerable, of which we cannot be too fond or tender, it bears the Image of Divinity; and if it were not in it ſelf a moſt excellent thing, the name of it, could never be made ſo ſpecious a pretence.</p>

               <p>It has been often, and confidently aſſerted, that all the Diſſenters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> have departed from the Unity and Communion of the Catholick Church: This lies as a mighty prejudice in the minds of many, both againſt our way,
<note place="margin">Arch-Rebel, p. 28. Reply, p. 1.</note> and perſons too; and their common Inference from hence is, That we are out of a State of Salvation, have no right to any of the Promiſes of the Goſpel, that all our Hopes are unwarrantable and groundleſs Fancies, that we are contemners of the Peace and Unity which Chriſt has bequeathed to his Church; and if they will demonſtrate, that our caſe is indeed ſuch as they deſcribe it, we will not perſiſt in it a day longer, for we cannot be ſo fond of the Inconveniencies of Non-Conformity here, as meerly for the ſake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to purchaſe to our ſelves, greater Miſeries hereafter.</p>
               <p>But that we may evince, how void of Reaſon and Humanity, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which they have paſt upon us is, let us enquire, wherein the Catholick Unity and Communion of the Church conſiſts, and then try, whether none of our Diſſenting Congregations be within the Verge of it.</p>
               <p>By this Catholick Unity, our Adverſaries underſtand, not that which is accidental, may be preſent or abſent without the deſtruction of the Subject, which ſome Churches may have, and other True Churches may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, for then it would not ſerve their purpoſe, which is to conclude all that want this Unity, to be in a State of Damnation; and indeed it is the trueſt acceptation of the word, to make it ſignifie Eſſential Univerſal Unity, (Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in accidentals belonging more properly to the common place of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) in this ſenſe, therefore we ſhall ſpeak of it, that we may come up as cloſe to their thoughts as we can.</p>
               <p>Nothing then belongs to the Catholick Unity of the Church, but what belongs to the being of the Church; that which makes it a Church makes it one; <hi>Ens &amp; Unum</hi> being convertible; and nothing can diſſolve its Unity which does not deſtroy its Eſſence; and certainly the being, and the ſtate of the Church muſt not be confounded: Many things are required to the due and orderly ſtate and form, in which the Church ought to be, and appear in the World, and which may contribute to her ſtability, beauty and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſuppoſe her Eſſence, but do not conſtitute it.</p>
               <p>This Eſſential Catholick Unity whereof we ſpeak, may be diſtinguiſhed into Political and Moral.</p>
               <p>Political, whereby all the True Members of the Church are united unto Chriſt the Head, and that is by true Faith: And</p>
               <p>Moral, by which they are United one to another, and that is by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Love, which in ſome degree always follows the former; thoſe that have a mind to it, may quarrel with the terms of this diſtinction; but if I may but expreſs my meaning by them, I ſhall not be at all concerned about it.</p>

               <p>This is the True Catholick Unity, deſcribed in the 4th of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>There is one Body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one Hope of your Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and the Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Moral Unity,</hi> by which the Members are knit one to another, is that of Love: This is the Unity of the Spirit, which is to be held in the bond of Peace, and will always flow from the other, by a kind of Spiritual Sympathy and Senſation; but it muſt be acknowledged, this admits of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious degrees, and is ſubject to ſinful Declenſions; Emulation, Paſſion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, Miſunderſtanding of Perſons and Things, may very much weaken the Bond of Amity, but it muſt be habitually in every True Chriſtian; and he that has no brotherly kindneſs, for thoſe that appear to him True Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers can never know that he has paſſed from Death to Life.</p>
               <p>Miſtakes and Weakneſs, may create Jealouſie, and too great Diſtances even amongſt great and good Men. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> from different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions about the management of their Work, proceed to a parting one from another: And too many Brethren, that have all the ſame Father, and are all bound for the ſame home, cannot forbear falling out by the way: The Corruption of Nature both fullies mens Graces, that they do not ſhine forth ſo clearly as otherwiſe they would, and alſo darkens their ſight, that they cannot ſo well diſcern the Virtues of each other, and where the Eye is dim, and the Object clouded too, no wonder if miſapprehenſions and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable ſurmiſes ariſe, and men miſtake one another for Enemies, and fall a quarrelling, when perhaps a true Light would let them ſee they are all Friends.</p>
               <p>But certainly, as far as Believers underſtand one another, they have Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Affection one for another; and if they knew more of the Truth of each others Chriſtianity, their Mutual Love would be greatly encreaſed. And a ſhyneſs in ſome tempers, and unwillingneſs to converſe more freely, and often together, keep up mens prejudices, and hinder their deſired Union; and yet they have ſtill a fervent Love for the Church in general, though their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be miſplaced as to particular perſons.</p>
               <p>This Brotherly-kindneſs, where it is prevalent, will oblige the Members to have the ſame care one for another, not envying, but rejoycing at each others Heath, Beauty, and Improvement, it would make them ſenſible of each others uſe ulneſs and ſervice, they would not think any part ſuperfluous, or tye it up from performing its duty towards the good of the whole; the Eye would not ſay to the Hand, I have no need of thee: This would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93151:10"/>them to reproach and deſpiſe each other, for their blemiſhes and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, but oblige them to cover the ſame with the greateſt candour and civility, and to beſtow more abundant honour upon thoſe parts that may be thought leſs honourable.</p>
               <p>This is that great Law of Love which the King of the Church has given to all his Diſciples, as the Bond of Peace amongſt themſelves, and the great Characteriſtick by which they ſhall be diſtinguiſhed from others:
<note place="margin">John 13.35.</note> By this ſhall all men know that they are Chriſt's Diſciples, if they love one another. Where the Soul is wholly deſtitute of this, all pretences of Love to God, or Faith in Chriſt, are falſe and vain;
<note place="margin">1 John 4.20.</note> 
                  <hi>For he that loves not his Brother whom he has ſeen, how can he love God whom he has not ſeen?</hi> And true Faith will work by Love.</p>
               <p>I know this Account of Catholick Unity, as conſiſting in Faith and Love, will not meet with general approbation: Many will reject it as to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, who have placed their hopes of Salvation in being of ſuch a Party, and in a Zealous Obſervation of the Rites and Ceremonies of that Communion in which they are, theſe are too ſenſleſs to be argued with, That can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Son of God would be incarnate, and crucified, only to teach men a particular kind of dreſs, and faſhionable geſtures, and a form of words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilſt their Souls are under the dominion of ſin, and they have not learned to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in an Evil World.</p>
               <p>Many will cenſure it as too narrow, excluding from the Church, all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and inſincere pretenders to Chriſtianity; but I ſuppoſe when we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand one another, we ſhall not much differ about this; it is certain <hi>in Foro Dei,</hi> none but true Diſciples are true Church-Members; but <hi>in Foro Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae,</hi> all that ſeem to be ſo, muſt be ſo accounted. When we ſay, ſuch a one is a Member of the Viſible Church, we mean, he is viſibly a Member of the Church, that is, he appears ſo to us, and we are obliged to think ſo of him, till he diſcovers the contrary; but whether he be really ſo or no, God only knows.</p>
               <p>And moſt will condemn this Notion, as too large and general, including even thoſe that have not a Regular Miniſtry amongſt them, nor are joyned to any particular Congregation, duly organized: And here indeed the main difficulty we have to encounter is about the Unity of the Miniſtry, and how far that is eſſential to the Unity of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>And I freely grant, every True Member of the Church of Chriſt, will give great deference to the Miniſterial Office; and whoever they be, that will preſume to ridicule the Function, and deſpiſe its juſt Powers, cannot in reaſon be thought to have the Faith and Charity of the Goſpel. But there muſt be a great difference made, betwixt contemning the Miniſtry, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning the Rights of this or that particular perſon to the Office, or ſcrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Term o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But though I do verily believe, it is eſſential to Catholick Church Unity, that every Member love and honour the Miniſterial Function; yet, I dare by no means affirm it to be equally neceſſary, that every Perſon be under the Conduct of a Regular and duely called Miniſtry; this indeed, is requiſite to the flouriſhing State of the Church, and all are obliged to pray for it, and endeavour it in their ſeveral Spheres of Activity; but it is not abſolutely Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Being of the Church, or the Salvation of her Members. My Reaſons are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. This would be to confound the Unity of the Church, with its Order, which muſt be diſtinguiſhed here, where we ſpeak of Eſſential Unity; that which belongs to the Order of the Church always ſuppoſes its Eſſence; a thing muſt firſt be, before it be capable of Order: Thus the Excellent Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> argues,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hiſtor. Def. of the Reform.</hi> Part 4. <hi>p.</hi> 57.</note> 
                  <q>To admit that to be a true Church where the Miniſtry is, and deny that to be a true Church, where the Miniſtry is not, is a vain, deceitful and illuſory way of reaſoning; For the true Church naturally goes before the Miniſtry, and does not depend upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, but the Miniſtry on the contrary depends upon it; as in the Civil Society, the Magiſtracy depends upon the Society, and not the Society on the Magiſtracy. In the Civil Society, the firſt thing that muſt be thought on, is, That Nature made Men; afterwards we conceive that ſhe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and United them together. And laſtly, from that Union which could not ſubſiſt without Order, Magiſtracy proceeded. It is the ſame thing in a Religious Society: The firſt thing that Grace did, was to produce Faith in the hearts of Men, after having made them believe ſhe united them, and formed a mutual Communion between them; and, becauſe their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ought not to be without Order, and good Government; from thence the Miniſtry aroſe. So that a Lawful Miniſtry is after the true Church, and depending upon it.</q> And a great deal more to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, This would make it utterly unlawful for the Laity to Reform the Church from idolatry, or other Abuſes, unleſs the Clergy would joyn with them in it; and ſo would condemn thoſe Princes and Churches in <hi>Germany,</hi> and elſewhere, that Reformed without their Biſhops; yea, againſt their Wills, and repeated clamorous Prohibitions. Either the Popiſh Biſhops and Clergy, were the regular Miniſtry of thoſe Churches before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or no; if they were not, then there was no Regular Miniſtry amongſt them, and the Line of Succeſſion failed; and either they had no Churches, or elſe their Churches re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ain'd their Beings without the Miniſtry: But if the Popiſh Clergy were the Regular Miniſtry, Then either thoſe that Reformed without them, were cut off from the Unity of the Catholick Church, and Reformed themſelves into Hell, as the Papiſts ſpeak, or elſe they were ſtill in the Unity of the Church, though at preſent without a Regular Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that will needs thruſt the Unity of the Epiſcopacy into the Deſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Catholick Church, would do well to conſider, Every Nation was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93151:11"/>not ſo happy as <hi>England,</hi> in having Biſhops ſo willing to comply with their Rulers, in a Seceſſion from <hi>Rome;</hi> or in having Rulers ſo Potent and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as ours were: And yet God forbid any Proteſtant ſhould ſay, they ought to have delayed their Reformation, till they had diſguſted Princes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Biſhops to lead them on. Surely, the lawfulneſs of our Departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> does not depend upon ſuch contingencies. How few Biſhops there were that gave the leaſt countenance to <hi>Luther</hi>'s Proceedings, none can be ignorant, that has read any thing of the Hiſtory of that Reformation; the Miniſtry they had was generally choſen by themſelves, out of the moſt learned of the Laicks, ſome few of the Prieſts and Monks falling in; the Nobles themſelves ſometimes devoted their Gifts to the Service of the Church, as the Prince of <hi>Anhalt, Du Pleſſis, Sadeel,</hi> and others; they never inſiſted upon an uninterrupted Line, but maintained, <q>That where the true Faith and Doctrine were, there was the true Church;
<note place="margin">Claudes <hi>Hiſt. Def.</hi> Part 4. <hi>p.</hi> 58.</note> and that it is the Call of the Church, <hi>and the Approbation of the moſt competent Judges therein,</hi> that makes a Lawful Call of Perſons to that Office, and that the Church has a full and entire Right to ſet up Miniſters for its Government, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it have the true Faith.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3dly, If there can be no true Church without a Regular Miniſtry, what becomes of the Being of a Church, when its Miniſters are dead and baniſhed, and no other yet choſen? By this Notion the Church muſt be diſſolved and die with them, and the Death of the Shepherd muſt be the Damnation of the Flock; for if the Regular Miniſtry of each particular Church, be the great Ligament, by which that part is faſtned to the whole, it muſt needs follow, that upon the Failure of the Miniſtry, it falls off from the Body, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from Chriſt the Head. If it be replied, that ſuch Societies remain in the Unity of the Church, whilſt they deſire a true Miniſtry, and endeavour to get one, though at preſent they are without it, That's as much as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; for then it is not eſſential to Catholick Unity, that there be a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Miniſtry, but that there be a deſire of it; and no doubt all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have ſuch deſires, and the great difference amongſt them is, which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry is moſt Regular; and, it is their apprehenſion of the greater Regularity of theirs than of others, that makes each ſide of them prefer their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, if we admit the abſolute Neceſſity, of ſuch a Miniſtry, under whoſe Conduct every Church muſt be; what ſhall we ſay of thoſe Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Tumults and Conteſts that have happened about the Election of Biſhops?

               <p>I cannot but have a great value for the Judgment of Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> in this particular, and ſhall therefore tranſcribe his words, in that learned Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe before mentioned,

                  <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>It is the Church that produces the Ordinary Miniſtry, and not the Ordinary Miniſtry that produces the Church; The Church was the fruit of the Extraordinary Miniſtry of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts; That Miniſtry of theirs, produc'd it at firſt, and not only produc'd it, but it has always made uſe of that means, or that ſource for its Subſiſtence; and we may truly ſay, That it yet produces it, and that it will produce it unto the End of the World: For it is the Faith that makes, and always will make the Church, and it is the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles that makes and always will make the Faith: It is their Voice that calls Chriſtians together at this day; it is their word that eſſembles them, and their teaching that unites them. It is certain that the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles was ſingular; that is to ſay, only tyed to their Perſons, without Succeſſion, without Communication or Propagation; but it ought not to be thought that it was alſo tranſitory, as that of other Men, for it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual in the Church; Death has not ſhut their Mouths as it has others, they ſpeak, they inſtruct, they inceſſantly ſpread abroad Faith and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93151:12"/>among the Souls of Chriſtians, and there is not another Fountain from whence thoſe Virtues can deſcend but from them. If any demand of us, what is the perpetual Voice that we aſcribe unto them? We anſwer, That it is the Doctrine of the New Teſtament, where they have ſet down all the Efficacy of their Miniſtry, and the whole virtue of that Word, which gave a Being to the Church; there is their true Chair and Apoſtolick See; there is the Center of Chriſtian Unity; there it is that they inceſſantly call Men, and joyn them into a Society—But as to the ordinary Miniſtry, we cannot ſay the ſame thing of them, it is not their Voice as diſtinct from that of the Apoſtles, that begets the Faith, that aſſembles Chriſtians into a Society, or that produces the Church: They are no more but meer Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the words of the Apoſtles, or external Inſtruments, to make us the better underſtand their Voice, to ſpeak properly, it is not the Voice of the ordinary Paſtors, that produces Faith, where it was not before, it is the word of the Apoſtles themſelves; They are no more but thoſe External Guides, that God has eſtabliſhed in the Church to lead Men to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and even ſuch Guides as cannot hinder us from going thither of our ſelves, if we will;—Therefore there is a great difference betwixt theſe two ſorts of Miniſters, the one preceded the Church, the other follows it; the one has an independent and ſovereign Authority, with Infallibility on its ſide; the other is expoſed to Vices, Diſorders, Errors and humane Weakneſſes, inferior to, and depending on the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed to affirm that no Man can be truly converted but by a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Miniſtry, would involve the Minds of Men in endleſs Perplexities: A Man muſt know all thoſe things that belong to the due miſſion of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and muſt be aſſured that all thoſe met in the perſon, by whoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry he was helped to believe, before he can know that he has true Faith; this would keep perſons in a dark and uncomfortable ſtate all their days, eſpecially if a Line of uninterrupted Succeſſion be neceſſary to a true Miſſion; for then a Man muſt be able to prove, that the Biſhop that ordained his Converter, was ordained by another Biſhop, and that by another, and ſo up to the Apoſtles; which, becauſe no man in the World can be morally aſſured of, it is impoſſible for any Man to know that he has true Faith. This is an inſuperable difficulty on the one hand.</p>
               <p>And on the other, thoſe Perſons that know they have true Faith by the powerful effects of it upon their Hearts and Lives, muſt conclude from hence that their Preachers were duely ordained and called, otherwiſe they could nor have been inſtrumental in their Converſion; and yet this would not be true, for doubtleſs there are many honeſt Souls that fear God, and work Righteouſneſs amongſt thoſe Sects, that have no Regular Miniſtry amongſt them: So that this Aſſertion would rob many Souls of the comfort of a true Faith, becauſe of the uncertainty of their Miniſters Miſſion; and it would confirm others in an irregular and unauthorized Miniſtry, becauſe of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainty of their Faith.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:93151:13"/>
               <p>I hope by this time I may venture to conclude, That the eſſential Unity of the Church, conſiſts in Goſpel-Faith and Love, hereby Men are made Saints, and unired to Chriſt, and Members of the Catholick Church.

                  <q>There is the Unity of ſubmitting to One Head, the Lord Jeſus; There is the Unity of Profeſſing the Common Faith that was once delivered to the Saints; There is a Unity of Sacraments; a Unity of Obedience to all the Laws and Inſtitutions of Chriſt, the Union of Chriſtian Affection and Brotherly Kindneſs: The Unity of Diſcipline and Government, by retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſubſtance the ſame Form that was left in the Church by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, an Unity of Communion in the Worſhip and Service of God.— Now to ſpeak clearly, there ought to be all theſe Kinds and Inſtances of Unity in the Church, but we ſee evidently they are not all thore; I mean in every part and Member of the Church, and therefore they are not all neceſſary to the being of a Church, but ſome of them are; and they are, The Acknowledgment of One Lord, the Profeſſion of One Faith, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the ſtate of Chriſtian Duties and Privileges by One Baptiſm: And this is all that I can find abſolutely neceſſary to the Being of a Church.</q>

                  <q>In ſuch a divided ſtate of Chriſtendom as this is, meer External Unity and Communion cannot be the mark of a true Church— All true Chriſtian Churches are United in the moſt Eſſential things;
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.5, 6.</note> They have <hi>one Hope, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and the Father of all;</hi> and this makes them one Body, animated by the ſame Holy Spirit, which dwells in the whole Chriſtian Church; but ſtill they are not One entire Communion, but divide and ſeparate from each other; this we will grant is a very great Fault, but yet if they Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in ſuch things as make one Church, their Quarrels and Diviſions may hurt themſelves, but cannot deſtroy the Unity of the Church, for the Church is one Body not meerly by the Agreement of Chriſtians among themſelves, but by the Inſtitution of Chriſt, who has made all thoſe that profeſs the ſame Faith, and are united in the ſame Sacraments, to belong to the ſame Body, to be his own Body: And therefore Chriſtians are never Exhorted to be One Body, for that they are, if they be Chriſtians, as the Apoſtle expreſly aſſerts; but they are exhorted to live in Unity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, becauſe they are One Body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3.</q>

               <p>I have e'en tired my ſelf with theſe Quotations, not for the ſake of our Cauſe, but out of Civility to the Citizen of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and Men of his Temper, that by taking up a falſe Idea of Catholick Unity, to the Excluſion of all thoſe that have not Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, are animated by it, to the greateſt Severities againſt them, concluding that thoſe who ſhut themſelves out of the Catholick Church, are well enough ſerved if they be caſt out of Civil Saciety, and denied the common Rights and Privileges of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Let us now examine this Gentieman's Notions about the Unity of the Church, which may give us a little diverſion in our Journey; He charges the Vindicator, with miſ-reporting his Deſcription of Unity,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> p. 16.</note> omitting that which was neceſſary to be added; and if he did ſo, he was very much to blame: But let us turn to the places, and try whether it be ſo or no.</p>
               <p>Thoſe words out of which we muſt draw his Notion of Unity are theſe, <q>Though there be a Multiplication of Churches by the encreaſe of Believers, yet no variation; they are all one with that Church firſt mentioned in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and all One with one another, being all United into one Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Society or Body, under One head Jeſus Chriſt,

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vindic.</hi> p. 16.</note> whereof Chriſt is the Head, having the ſame Baptiſm, the ſame Faith, and the ſame Euchariſt.</q> Now what has he omitted, that belonged to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Unity? why he ſhould have added, They are all One with that Church firſt mentioned at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but that he left out; and he ſhould have added, They are all one with one another: and again, They are in all things the ſame with that firſt Church, but he omitted both theſe: A very dangerous Omiſſion! But pray, what do all theſe three Sentences amount to, more than this ſingle Aſſertion, the Catholick Church is One? Not one of them anſwers the Queſtion wherein it is One, it is no explanation of the Unity of the Church, to ſay it is all One with the Primitive Church, and all One with it ſelf, and the ſame with that firſt Church; ſtill the Queſtion is, wherein is the Church One? wherein does the Unity of all true Churches conſiſt? For to ſay they are One, becauſe they are One, and becauſe they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93151:15"/>are the ſame, and all One with one another, is a moſt vain and ridiculous Tautology, which the Vindicator was ſo civil as to paſs by, only fixing upon thoſe words that tell us wherein they are One, even as united into One Body, under One Head, having the ſame Baptiſm, Faith and Euchariſt, and ſo united in the Worſhip of God; the other Phraſes barely aſſert the Unity, theſe deſcribe and explain it; But this Gentleman knows not when he is well dealt with, but will force us to expoſe him whether we will or no.</p>
               <p>The Vindicator having thus Collected out of his words, a deſcription of Unity, as conſiſting in the ſame Lord, and in the ſame Baptiſm, Faith and Euchariſt, agrees to it with this Explanation. <hi>[that is the ſame for Subſtance]</hi> for it does not appear that they all agreed in the Primitive Times in the ſame Circumſtances; and infers from hence that there may be Catholick Unity, without Dioceſan Epiſcopacy and Ceremonies; neither of which he put into his Deſcription.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman's reply to this is very remarkable, for thus it goes; <q>It is plain, all that he drives at here is, that there may be a true Church-Unity without Epiſcopacy, which Doctrine is a meer Innovation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> But why did he not then inſert the Unity of Epiſcopacy in his Deſcription? If he left it out, it was not to be expected the Vindication ſhould foiſt it in for him, as he now would do himſelf, but it is too late, and to add it now, is not a Defence of his former Paper, but an Amendment rather, ſuch as it is, but indeed reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the moſt Judicious of the Epiſcopal Writers, as has been already evinced; to which I will here add one citation more, that I may either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him out of his frenzy, or leave him inexcuſable; 'tis the Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>The Summary of the late Controverſies betwixt the Church of</hi> England <hi>and the Church of</hi> Rome.

But the Church may be the One Body of Chriſt without being One Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Body, under One Governing Head, which 'tis impoſſible the whole Chriſtian Church ſhould be; and therefore a Church that divides it ſelf from that Eccleſiaſtical Body, to which it did once belong, if it have juſt and neceſſary Reaſons for what it does, is wholly blameleſs, nay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for it, if it have not, it ſins according to the Nature and Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Crime; but ſtill may be a Member of the Catholick Church, and ſtill enjoy all the Privileges of the Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints, and Promiſes of Everlaſting Life; which ſhews how the Holy Catholick Church in the Creed may be One; Norwithſtanding all thoſe Diviſions of Chriſtendom, which are cauſed by the Quarrels of Biſhops, and Diſputes about Eccleſiaſtical Canons and Juriſdiction.</q>

God will one day convince men that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church lies more in the Unity of Faith and Affection, than in the Uniformity of doubtful Rites and Ceremonies.</note> ſince the Unity of the Church conſiſts in the true Catholick Faith and Chriſtian Affection, whereby Men are knit to Chriſt the Head, and to one another; None are out of the Unity of the Church, but thoſe that are deſtitute of theſe fundamental Graces, and to affirm this of Proteſtant Diſſenters in general, is a piece of Diaboliſm which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel abhors, and Humanity it ſelf will be aſhamed of. We muſt firſt prove that Men are without Faith, before we can prove that they are without the Church, and not (with the Papiſts) condemn them as void of Faith, becauſe out of the external Communion of their Church. It is a very fooliſh and miſleading method, to prove our intereſt in the Faith, by our intereſt in the Church, as if we muſt firſt know the true Church, and that we are in it, before we can know the true Faith or that it is in us: this way of arguing has been always condemned by Proteſtant Writers. The Scripture Teſt for the trial of our Faith, is a ſerious endeavour to perfect Holineſs in the fear of God, to be careful to maintain good works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And indeed nothing but groſs Hereſie and known conſtant Immoralities, can warrant us, in ſaying, that any who profeſs to be Chriſtians are deſtitute of the Faith: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> do not generally ſhew as much of the fear of God, both in their Fumilies and common Converſation as their Neighbours, muſt be left to the Conſciences of all obſerving Men here, and the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God hereafter.</p>
               <p>And I hope they may modeſtly juſtifie their pretenſions to Chriſtian Love and Charity too; I am ſure their quiet and peaceable behaviour under ſo many years ſevere Perſecution, will plead more ſtrongly for them, than for thoſe by whom they ſuffered ſuch things; all the World will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, how unable thoſe Gentlemen were to bear a very ſmall ſhare of thoſe Severities themſelves, which they had for a long time ſo liberally inflicted upon others.</p>
               <p>I am far from the thoughts of charging theſe things upon the Epiſcopal
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93151:16"/>Party in general, or even the Clergy themſelves; but all the Nation will bear witneſs, 'tis too true concerning thoſe Biſhops and others that were formerly moſt uneaſie and troubleſom to their Diſſenting Brethren.</p>
               <p>How odd a thing was it, for this Gentleman to begin his Book, with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyricks upon Peace, when the avowed deſign is to juſtifie all thoſe Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations thereof, that have been the ſcandal of the Proteſtant Religion. He tells us of a bleſſed Legacy left us by our dying Redeemer, and why then ſhould we not be ſuffered to enjoy it? I am ſure we ſhould have been glad to have lived in the obſcureſt places and circumſtances, where we might have enjoyed that Sacred Bequeſt; but there were a Generation of Men amongſt us, who having ſpent their own Legacies, would needs deprive us of ours, unleſs we would ſurrender the dearer Peace of our own minds. I am afraid it is the conſcienciouſneſs of their former guilt, that makes many of them, ſo very ſuſpicious and jealous of Diſſenters as they are; they can hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we have any Charity for them, becauſe they know how little they have diſcovered towards us: And thus the remembrance of what is paſt, puſhes them on to farther abuſes, inſtead of producing fruits meet for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; whereas I do verily believe the generality of Diſſenters can heartily forgive all that's paſt, and would be glad to ſee any ground of hope that the ſame men would not greedily embrace the firſt opportunity of acting over again their former exceſſes.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I Hope we have ſafely paſſed the Ordeal of Catholick Unity; we now proceed to defend our ſelves, from the dreadful Accuſation of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Superiors; for though our Non-Conformity ſhould not utterly exclude us from the Unity and Communion of the Catholick Church, yet if it involve us in the guilt of Sedition, contempt of our Lawful Governours, and diſobedience to their juſt Commands, our Cauſe would be bad enough, and we could by no means juſtifie it before God or the World.</p>
               <p>The Indictment charges upon us a twofold Diſobedience; Firſt, Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our Spiritual Governours the Biſhops; And ſecondly, To the Civil Magiſtrate likewiſe; but we do verily believe our ſelves to be innocent, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93151:16"/>deſire an impartial hearing of our juſt Defence, which will proceed in this Method.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We plead that Biſhops have no Power by the Law of God, but what Presbyters have as well as they.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the whole Juriſdiction of our Engliſh Biſhops, and Power of their Canons, is derived from the Civil Magiſtrate, and Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Civil Powers have left us to our Liberty in the caſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and therefore we are guilty of no Diſobedience to them.</p>
               <p>The firſt Poſition, concerning the Identity of Power in Biſhops and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, has been often and warmly debated, and we can ſcarce touch it ſo gently, but it will be reſented as an high affront; it is accounted a Plea to their Juriſdiction, which in all Courts has an ungrateful ſound, and muſt expect to be over-ruled, if powerful Intereſt, and loud Menaces can do it; and yet it ſeems ſo clear in it ſelf, both from Scripture, Fathers, and Proteſtant Divines, our own Reformers not excepted, that were it not for the ſake of the Silver Shrines, we cannot ſuppoſe it would have been a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie at this day in any of the Reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>For Scripture Proof, the Point being Negative, the Evidence that is but Negative, muſt be allowed ſufficient. The Word of God no where aſſerts, that Biſhops are a Superior Order to Presbyters, therefore they are not ſo by that Law: Thoſe that ſay they are, muſt produce that Rule which makes them ſo: If no ſuch Rule appears, the matter is fully concluded againſt them.</p>
               <p>This being a Queſtion concerning a very great Power, extending to a great number of Perſons, and producing great Effects, a matter of great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and dependencies, ought to have clear and poſitive Warrant and Commiſſion, from the Word of God. Meer Names and Titles, Suppoſitions, and fine Probabilities, will not all make a Foundation ſtrong enough, to bear the weight of a Structure, ſo high and towering, as our Engliſh Prelacy.</p>
               <p>It is far ſhort of Demonſtration to ſay, the Biſhops are the Apoſtles Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and therefore a higher Order than Presbyters: For if they mean that they have the ſame Power that the Apoſtles had, and in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, it will diſtort their own Scheme of Government, and will not only give them power over Presbyters, but over Biſhops too, for ſuch power the Apoſtles had, and it will give every Biſhop an Univerſal Power over all the Churches in the World; If it be ſaid they are only the Apoſtles Succeſſors in ſome part of their power, the anſwer is obvious, ſo are Presbyters too: and we muſt enquire in what parts and degrees of power do they ſucceed them? And why do not Presbyters ſucceed them in the ſame powers? And where ſhall we find any chapter or verſe in our Bibles, that thus divide the power, and give ſome men the power of Doctrine, and others that of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Orders; where is the diſcrimination? We find it very plain in Dr. <hi>Coſins</hi>'s Table, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot ſo in thoſe of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:93151:17"/>
               <p>Nor is it any more to our ſatisfaction, to ſay that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Biſhops of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> for the Queſtion is not whether there were Biſhops in Scripture times, but whether thoſe Biſhops had any power that the Presbyters had not, and if they had, whether it belongs to them as Biſhops, or on ſome other account, St. <hi>Peter</hi> was a Presbyter, and had Authority over Biſhops, muſt we therefore argue that Presbyters had power over Biſhops: <hi>Timothy</hi> had Authority to command Biſhops too, and joined with <hi>Paul</hi> in Writing a Canonical Epiſtle to the Biſhops and Deacons of <hi>Philippi?</hi> will it therefore follow that one Biſhop has Authority over another?</p>
               <p>And what did <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> that Presbyters might not do, if they had the ſame qualifications? They ordained Elders, and how does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they did not do it, as being Elders themſelves? and that they had not the aſſiſtance of others? And may not Presbyters do ſo too? Perhaps it will be ſaid, no, for they have not the Epiſcopal Power; but that is the very thing in queſtion, and muſt be proved, and not taken for granted; if God has laid no injunction upon them to the contrary men cannot do it; 'Tis an odd way of reaſoning, <hi>Titus</hi> was left to ordain Elders in <hi>Crete,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was a Biſhop, for none but Biſhops can Ordain, how do you prove that? Why becauſe <hi>Titus</hi> was a Biſhop and he alone did Ordain; if this be not a Circular, Precarious and Trifling way of arguing, nothing in the World deſerves that name.</p>
               <p>But indeed the many removes which <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> made, is argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough that they were not the fixed Paſtors of particular Churches; no queſtion wherever they came, they were employed in the ſame work, which they did at <hi>Epheſus:</hi> and why <hi>Titus</hi> by being ſent into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> did not become the Biſhop of the Churches there, as well as by being leſt in <hi>Creet,</hi> the Biſhop of the <hi>Cretians,</hi> I ſee no reaſon; he was ſent to the one, he was left in the other; and doubtleſs in both, his work was to ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the things that were wanting, and this was his buſineſs every where, and would as well entitle him the Biſhop of any other place, as of <hi>Creet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The argument from the Angels of the Churches, is as dark and inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as the former: thoſe meſſages ſent to the Churches were delivered by Viſion, and in the ſtyle and phraſe of Viſion, a ſingular term is often to be underſtood collectively: as by the falſe Prophet, A. B. <hi>Uſher</hi> underſtands the Roman Clergy; and there are many words in thoſe Epiſtles that favour this Interpretation, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. and there is not one word in all that Book, intimating that thoſe Angels were ſingle perſons, much leſs ſuch as had any power above Presbyters. And thoſe that grant them to be ſingle perſons will tell us; the moſt that can be inferr'd, is a Preſident or Moderator of a Presbytery, which is allowed by thoſe that are wholly diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with Dioceſan Prelacy.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman pas;ſes very lightly over all theſe difficulties, and in a ſtrain of careleſsneſs and confidence natural to him, tells us. <q>It is evident that the Government of the Church by Epiſcopacy, was of Apoſtolical Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93151:17"/>for that <hi>Timothy</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Creet,</hi> as is plain by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles to them both; that the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> which received the Chriſtian Faith had each a Biſhop is evident, by the Title St. <hi>John</hi> gives them in his Letters to them.</q> This is the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans proof of the Divine right of our Engliſh Prelacy, this is that mighty evidence and demonſtration, he ſo often refers to in his Pamphlet, ſaying, I have proved, I have ſhewed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if it was ſo plain from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Biſhops, why did he not tell us what words thoſe are which make it ſo very plain? Indeed the Poſtſcripts to thoſe Epiſtles, expreſly call them Biſhops of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> but does he need to be told, that the Poſtſcripts are no part of Canonical Scripture, nor joined with the Epiſtles for ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt; <hi>Theodoret</hi> being the firſt that mentions them, only as part of his own Commentary, and yet he has not the word Biſhop in them; Nor any body elſe till <hi>Oecumenius</hi> who wrote above a thouſand years after Chriſt: nay the very Poſtſcripts themſelves prove that they are of much later date than the Epiſtles, for in one of them <hi>Phrygia</hi> is called <hi>Pacatiana,</hi> which was not the name of it till above three hundred years after Chriſt, when it was conquered by one <hi>Pacatius</hi> a Roman General, and after him called <hi>Pacatiana;</hi> and in the Poſtſcript to <hi>Titus,</hi> it is ſaid the Epiſtle was writ from <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> which it could not be, ſince in the Epiſtle it ſelf, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Nicopolis</hi> a place whither he deſigned to go and Winter, and would have <hi>Titus</hi> come to him there; come to me to <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> for there (not here) I deſign to Winter; theſe Poſtſcripts therefore betray themſelves by their own language.</p>
               <p>And he ſhould have told us, what there is in the word Angel that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a Dioceſan Biſhop, but inſtead thereof tells us a long ſtory out of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> which is worſe than impertinent, for it affirms that thoſe Angels were not Dioceſan Biſhops, but Metropolitanes, or Arch-Biſhops, that had Biſhops under them;

<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Morrice</hi> of Dioceſan Ep. ſcop. p. 27.</note> and let the Biſhops be Metropolitans, holding only by Eccleſiaſtical Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any proper Authority over the Presbyters, and we ſhall not much differ from them.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſee what evidence may be brought to prove that Presbyters are of the ſame Order with Biſhops, and have the ſame power as they. And</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. It is no contemptible argument that Presbyters are frequently called Biſhops in Scripture, that the names are uſed promiſcuouſly the greateſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93151:18"/>of the Prelacy acknowledge; the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> are ſo called <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. The Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> are called Biſhops; and it is obſervable that the Syriack Verſion, which is very antient, has but one word for Presbyter and Biſhop; now if there be ſo material a diſſerence betwixt a Biſhop and a Presbyter, as ſome men would make, it is ſtrange there ſhould not be a diſtinct word to expreſs it by: if only ſuch as are now owned to be Biſhops were called Presbyters, the argument would not be ſo ſtrong, for they might think to evade it by ſaying, the leſſer is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the greater, and they are Presbyters before they are Biſhops, but when even thoſe who are acknowledged to be meer Presbyters, are called Biſhops, it is very conſiderable, for the leſſer cannot include the greater; it would ſound very ſtrange in <hi>England</hi> for a Presbyter to write himſelf Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: and if the Apoſtles had known any thing of this mighty diſtinction, upon which the Fate of ſo many Churches, and Salvation of ſo many Souls is made to depend, we cannot ſuppoſe they would have laid ſuch a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before us, to draw us into an opinion of the Identity of Order, by the indifferent and promiſcuous uſe of the Titles.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Morrice</hi> in his defence of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, makes very little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Title of Biſhops being given to Presbyters in the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 29, 30.</note> and is pleaſed to ſay, <q>This debate about the Biſhops of <hi>Philippi</hi> had ſoon been at an end, if our Author had thought fit to explain himſelf, and told us what he meant by Biſhops, for were the Paſtors of ſingle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations reſpectively in Covenant? Then there muſt have been ſeveral Congregations or Churches in the ſame City, which Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> will not allow: Or were thoſe Biſhope only Presbyters ruling the Church of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi</hi> with common and equal authority? Then our Authour muſt give up the queſtion, and inſtead of making many Biſhops, muſt own that there was none at all there but onely Presbyters, will he contend that there were no other Biſhops than Presbyters? That will be to abuſe his Reader with the Ambiguity of a Word, which he takes in one ſence, and the Church in another, that many Presbyters might belong to one Congregation none ever denied, but that many Biſhops in the Allow'd and Eccleſiaſtical ſence of the Word, had the overſight of one City, ſeems ſtrange and incredible to the Antient Chriſtians. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerving this expreſſion of the Biſhops of <hi>Philippi,</hi> ſeems to be ſtartled with it; What many Biſhops in one City? By no means, it cannot be, what then? They were not Biſhops properly ſo called, but Presbyters.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have taken the more notice of this Paragraph,
<note place="margin">Works of the Learned <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> p. 25.</note> becauſe <hi>La Croſe</hi> magnifies it as a terrible <hi>Dilemma,</hi> though he has lamentably ſpoiled it in the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but taking it as the Dr. has laid it before us, I ſee not how it can much weaken our Cauſe or fortifie his own: We do really maintain that theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were Presbyters, ruling the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> with common conſent, and whether this be the Eccleſiaſtical ſence of the word or no, we are not much concerned to enquire; it is ſufficient to our purpoſe that it is the true

Thus a Learned Canoniſt gives it as the Vogue of many Primitive Authors:

                  <q>That Biſhop and Presbyter were formerly the ſame, and that Presbyter was the Name of the Perſons Age, Biſhop of his Office, but there being many of theſe in every Church, they determined amongſt themſelves for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of Schiſm, that one ſhould be Elected by themſelves to be ſet over the reſt, and the Perſon ſo elected, retained the Name of Biſhop for Diſtinction ſake; the reſt were only called Presbyters, and in proceſs of time, their Reverence for theſe Biſhops ſo encreaſed, that they began to obey them as Children do a Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly, Not only the ſame Title, but the ſame Powers are aſcribed to Biſhops and Presbyters in Scripture; both that of Juriſdiction and that of Orders, as they are uſually diſtinguiſhed. As to the former, we read of ruling Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that Rule well be accounted worthy of double honour;</hi> If this Rule be not the ſame with their Juriſdiction, where lies the difference? and where will they find as plain Scripture for the pretended Juriſdiction of Prelates, as here we have for the ruling Power of Presbyters? and that Admonition of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> is worthy our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2, <hi>The Presbyters which are amongſt you I exhort, who am alſo a Presbyter, and a witneſs of the Sufferings of Chriſt— Feed the Flock of God which is amongſt you, taking the Overſight thereof,</hi> &amp;c. The Spiritual Juriſdiction of Presbyters, is here expreſs'd by two words, [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] which the Defenders of the Hierarchy contend, does not ſignifie barely to Feed, but to provide Food as the Governor of a Family, and is often uſed for Government, and ſometimes that of Princes; but however it certainly ſignifies the office of a Paſtor, and is a good Argument that the Paſtoral Power is veſted in Presbyters; The other word is [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] taking the overſight, or the Epiſcopal Office, doing the work of a Biſhop; if this will not prove that the Epiſcopal Juriſdiction belongs to Presbyters, I deſpair of ever underſtanding the meaning of words.</p>
               <p>The Power of Orders is with the ſame clearneſs attributed to Presbyters; <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelf, who they ſay was a Biſhop, receives his Office or Gift by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93151:19"/>the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery. To this the Gent. replies, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſays that thoſe Presbyters were Apoſtles; but that is only the Doctors conjecture, and yet if the Apoſtles were concerned in it, it is plain they acted as Presbyters, whether they were Apoſtles, or Biſhops, or Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, they acted as a Presbytery. I doubt not but if it had been ſaid, <hi>The Gift which thou receivedst by the laying on of the hands of the Epiſcopacy;</hi> theſe Gentlemen would have preſently concluded that Ordination belongs to Biſhops as ſuch, and would have given us very hard words, if we ſhould have dared to diſpute it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> themſelves, who are called Apoſtles, received their Ordination from Prophets and Teachers, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. and it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable before this, neither of them were called Apoſtles; but preſently after they were, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Theſe things have ſo gravel'd the Learned Defenders of Dioceſan Prelacy, that they have not agreed amongſt themſelves how to find out a tolerable Evaſion;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diſſert.</hi> 4. Cap 19, 20. <hi>Vind of Diſſert.</hi> p. 26.</note> but their moſt famous Doctors have taken quite contrary Paths. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſaw there was no way to come off, but by holding that all the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters we read of in Scripture, were Biſhops; and that there was no inferior Order inſtituted by the Apoſtles, but that preſently after in <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s time we meet with them. Now this is as much as we deſire, for it fully proves that by Divine Right Biſhops and Presbyters are the ſame, and that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction was not founded upon any Scripture Rule, but only an ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: I perceive many have learnt out of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> to evade all theſe inſtances of the Powers given to Presbyters in Scripture, by ſaying, Thoſe were not meer Presbyters; and when we ask them what they mean by meer Presbyters, they anſwer, ſuch as were not alſo Biſhops, and we grant they were not meer Presbyters if that be the ſignification of it, nor were there any ſuch meer Presbyters in Scripture that we know of.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> on the other hand ſays,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſon. of Separ.</hi> p. 269.</note> That the Apoſtles in their times managed the Government of the Churches themſelves, and therefore there was then no Biſhop, but they were all one with Presbyters; but that as the Apoſtles went off, Biſhops came to be ſettled in the ſeveral Churches. Now though it is moſt certain the Apoſtles did not manage the Government of particular Churches themſelves, but put it into the hands of the Presbyters, they themſelves ſtill holding an Univerſal Superintendency; yet we gladly accept the Conceſſion of this learned Prelate; 'tis indeed <hi>à regione</hi> adverſe to Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> but will equally ſerve our purpoſe; the one ſays, there were no Presbyters in Scripture times inferior to Biſhops; the other, there were no Biſhops ſuperior to Presbyters: Our concluſion flows alike naturally and freely from both, that in Scripture times Biſhops and Presbyters were of the ſame Order.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, We have no Rules laid down in Scripture for the Ordination of any Biſhops but what are the ſame with Presbyters; in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. we have the Qualifications of Biſhops and Deacons deſcribed, and no mention made
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93151:19"/>of Presbyters, becauſe they were the ſame with the Biſhops; and unleſs we acknowledge that, we ſhall be utterly at a loſs for a Reaſon of that Omiſſion, and there are few Commentators but underſtand it ſo: The learned <hi>Grotius</hi> upon this place ſays, the Presbyters of the Churches are here called Biſhops or Inſpectors, but that afterward that Name was given <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>

A late Author thought this ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that he puts a new ſence upon the words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] plainly ſignifies to conſtitute and ordain, and when the Perſons are mentioned, it is in the capacity to which they are ordain'd not from which they were advanced, as <hi>Ariſtot. in Polit,</hi>

               <p>Now if this diſtinction of Order had been known in Apoſtolical times, it is very ſtrange we ſhould not have a diſtinct Rule for the Ordination of the one, and the Conſecration of the other; eſpecially ſince by the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all, it is not having many Congregations, or Presbyters under him that makes a Biſhop, but only a peculiar, and higher Ordination: And yet we find no footſteps of it, but on the contrary, in the very Directory for Ordination of Presbyters, they are called Biſhops: Surely theſe things are as clear proof that Biſhops were not a Superior Order as a Negative is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, and there being no one Text in Scripture that affirms the diſtinction <hi>Semper praeſumitur pro negante,</hi> we muſt have concluded in the Negative, though we had not had theſe proofs.</p>
               <p>But what is wanting in Scripture, they hope to make up out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils, in behalf of Dioceſan Prelacy; it is certain they think their greateſt ſtrength lies there: And we deny not that many of the Fathers ſeem to make a great difference betwixt Biſhops and Presbyters; but this does not overthrow our Hypotheſis; for if they are the ſame in Scripture, the Sayings of the Fathers cannot make them otherwiſe, and yet few or none of the Ancients ſay that they are diſtinct Orders, much leſs that they are ſo by divine right; but ſome of them acknowledge the contrary, as we ſhall preſently ſhew.</p>
               <p>It is not therefore their uſing the Name of Biſhop in a ſence diſtinct from that of Presbyter, or requiring Presbyters to be obedient to their Biſhop, that will prove a ſuperiority of order <hi>jure divino;</hi> for we grant that it was the early Practice of the Church to chooſe one of the Graveſt and Wiſeſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93151:20"/>of the Presbyters, and conſtitute him Preſident over the reſt; and that where there were many Presbyters in a particular Church, commonly the Eldeſt or worthieſt was as Paſtor, and the other his Aſſiſtants, but ſtill we know the Parſon and the Curates are of the ſame order; and every Biſhop in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is equal in order to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> though they take an Oath of Canonical Obedience to him; the ſame we ſay of the diſtinction betwixt Biſhop and Presbyter in Primitive Times.</p>
               <p>This would be a ſufficient reply unto the Antiquities this Gentleman has alledged, but leſt he ſhould think he has done a mighty feat in tranſcribing theſe Paſſages, I ſhall animadvert more particularly upon them.</p>
               <p>He begins with the Canons of the Apoſtles, but why they ſhould take place of <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> I cannot tell, unleſs he has a Mind to cheat us with the Name, or was cheated by it himſelf. Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> reckons them among the Suppoſititious Works of the Firſt Age; and Dr. <hi>Beveridge,</hi> who has laboured ſo hard to defend them againſt <hi>Daille,</hi> only contends that they were written by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> near the latter End of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Century. But what ſay theſe Canons? why they ſay, <q>Let not the Presbyters or Deacons do any thing without the conſent of the Biſhop, for he hath the People of the Lord entruſted to him, and there ſhall one day be required of him an Account of their Souls.</q> Here (ſays the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman) the Biſhop has the Power of governing the Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons;

               <p>And is there one word here to prove that the Biſhop was of a Superior Order? The Curates of a Church are to have the direction and conſent of the Parſon, and yet the Order is the ſame; And it deſerves to be conſidered whether 'tis likely this Biſhop the Canon ſpeaks of, was any more than the Paſtor of a particular Church, ſince he muſt be ſuppoſed capable of giving the Neceſſary Orders for management of all Affairs, and nothing muſt be done without his conſent; it would be a Rule hard to be obſerved, as our preſent Dioceſes are Modell'd; and if Presbyters muſt do nothing without the Biſhops conſent, they muſt do nothing at all, the whole time being too little for Travel and Conſultation, there would be none left for Action; unleſs by conſent, we muſt underſtand a general Permiſſion to do what they pleaſe, without conſulting him at all in particular Matters, which would be a very odd Comment upon ſuch a Text, and not very well agreeing with the Reaſon that is added for this conſent, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Biſhop has the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord committed to him, and ſhall give an account of their Souls. Surtly this requires a more careful and near inſpection, than to commit the care of all by an Act of general conſent to others, without ever intending a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93151:20"/>perſonal Acquaintance with one of a Thouſand,
<note place="margin">Preſ. Treat. of Repentance.</note> ſo ſolemnly committed to him. Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſays he is ſure we cannot give an Account of thoſe Souls of whom we have no notice.</p>
               <p>The next paſſage is out of <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> a Piece of Antiquity which all the World has a great Veneration for; that which the Gentleman thinks is for his purpoſe, he gives us thus; <q>The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles foreſeeing that there would be Contentions about the Name or Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Biſhop or Epiſcopacy, they ſet down a Liſt or Continuation of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, that when any died, ſuch a certain perſon ſhould ſucceed him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But this place in <hi>Clement</hi> is very falſly recited, and whoever furniſhed him with it abuſed him, and impoſed upon his Ignorance. This Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor whoever he be, would have us to think that the Apoſtles ſet down a Liſt of the Names of thoſe that were to Succeed in the Epiſcopal See; this we cannot admit, until he tell us where this Liſt is to be found? how far it went? It ſeems it was a Continuation of Succeſſors, but it is hard to imagine how they could have the Names of Perſons ſo ready, that were yet unborn, and unconverted; we know an Infallible Spirit could reveal it to them, but ſurely then we ſhould have had it in the Canon of Scripture; ſuch a thing would have been of ſingular Uſe, not only for prevention of Diſputes about the choice of Biſhops, but for the Uncontroulable Evidence of the Truth of Chriſtianity, when they were able to produce a Prophetical Liſt, with the Names of Perſons then unborn, and yet all in due time appearing, and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Chair according to that Sacred Roll: for theſe Reaſons we cannot but reject the Fiction of any ſuch Liſt of Names, which when one died, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that ſuch a certain Perſon ſhould ſucceed him.</p>

                  <q>It ſhould ſeem that in thoſe firſt times before Dioceſan were divided into leſſer and ſubordinate Churches, we now call Pariſhes, and Presbyters aſſigned to them, they had not only one Altar in one Church or <hi>Dominicum,</hi> but one Altar to a Church, taking a Church for the Company or Corporation of the faithful, united under one Biſhop, and that was in the City and place where the Biſhop had his Reſidence.</q> Dr. <hi>Morrice</hi> would diſable this Evidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> expreſſes it with Caution and Modeſty, <hi>it ſhould ſeem.</hi> But ſuch modeſty makes it more valuable, being the humor and way of that learned man; he had made as ſtrict reſearches into theſe things, as he could, and upon the whole it ſeemed thus to him, but if there was a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Caution, obſerved in the Words, ſome will be apt to think, it was not for want of evidence, that the caſe was really ſo, but rather becauſe he knew the Notion would not be very agreeable to the Governours of that Church of which he was an Excellent Member.</p>
               <p>The Author of a late Treatiſe, called a <hi>Defence of Pluralities,</hi> ſuppoſed to be Mr. <hi>Wharton,</hi> notwithſtanding the heights of his Zeal for the Hierarchy, which appear ſufficiently throughout the Book, yet ingenuouſly acknowledges, <q>That at the beginning,
<note place="margin">Page 59.</note> the Biſhop and his Presbyters lived altogether in one common place, and were maintain'd by the free Oblations of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which were brought to the Cathedral and depoſited upon the Altar or Communion Table, when the number of Chriſtians encreaſed they began to build more Churches than one in a City, theſe new Churches were but as Chappels of Eaſe, annexed to and depending upon the Cathedral Church, where the Holy Euchariſt was Conſecrated.</q>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93151:22"/>own; and if this cannot be had with the good Will and Conſent of that El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Church and Biſhop, who had been inſtrumental in the Converſion of this new Colony, they may, no doubt, do it without them, if general Edification require it.</p>
               <p>Thus I have briefly examined our Gentlemans Antiquities, what Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he or his Cauſe has received by them, he has now leiſure to conſider; Let us ſee whether the Primitive Fathers are no more favourable to us than they have been to him. And I would lay down this, as a juſt remark upon theſe proofs out of Antiquity, That, one Paſſage which expreſly tells us, what kind of Superiority, Biſhops had in Primitive times over Presbyters, and how they came by it, is of more value in this Controverſie, than a ſcore, that barely mention that Superiority; the one ſpeaks directly to the Queſtion, the other not; we acknowledge thoſe whom the Fathers call Biſhops, had ſome kind of Superiority, over thoſe called Presbyters, and it is a vain thing for Perſons to ſweat and toil, in proving that which we never deny, but will grant them at the firſt demand, but the Controverſie turning upon this very hinge, whether it was a Superiority of Order by Divine Inſtitution, thoſe Ancients that ſpeak purpoſely to this Point, are the moſt proper Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this cauſe.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks as directly to the Queſtion, as 'tis poſſible for one to do; he poſitively aſſerts, and largely proves, that Biſhops and Presbyters are the ſame,

               <p n="1">1. The Schiſms he ſpeaks of, were occaſioned by their differences about thoſe Presbyters, that had governed them by common Conſent; but that of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was about the Apoſtles, it cannot be ſuppoſed, that by the common Council of Presbyters; <hi>Jerom</hi> ſhould mean, <hi>Paul, Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> governing in Common the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Schiſm <hi>Jerom</hi> ſpeaks of, was too much promoted, by the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters

He does not date this Diſtinction of Order, from the time that the People only contended about their Miniſters, but when the Miniſters alſo, influenced thoſe Contentions, and made themſelves the Heads of Parties, accounting thoſe their own who had been baptized by them; now this was not the <hi>Corinthian</hi> caſe, for there the Apoſtle was ſo far from encouraging thoſe ſidings, that he expreſly condemns them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Schiſm he ſpeaks of, was remedied by chooſing one of thoſe Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters they contended about; and ſetting him over the reſt, and committing the whole care of the Church to him, but I hope none will ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> was ſet above <hi>Cephas,</hi> or he above <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo</hi> above them both, to heal the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Schiſm; and therefore the riſe of Prelacy is not to be dated from that very Schiſm; but from others, that afterwards happened in the Churches.</p>
               <p>And it has been obſerved by a very learned Doctor, That the Arguments which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> brings for this Parity,

               <p>It is too evident to be concealed, that <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> though otherwiſe a Worthy and Good Man, was of a hot and eager Temper, raſh in his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and ſometimes tranſported into great irregularities of Practice, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the diſturbance he made at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93151:23"/>enquiring into the Reaſons of it, till by this Cuſtom, People began to conclude, that ſuch Prayers were profitable for the dead, and that thoſe who had not lived ſo well as they ſhould do, might obtain the pardon of their Sins by the Interceſſions of the Living; which I confeſs, was a very natural Thought, and ſhews us the eaſie progreſs of Superſtition, that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms taken up without any good Reaſon, will find ſome reaſon, though a very bad one when they grow Popular; upon this <hi>Aerius</hi> condemns the Practice, and he is reckoned amongſt Hereticks for ſo doing; He deſired to know for what Reaſon, the Names of dead men are recited in the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Euchariſt, and Prayers made for them, whether by this means thoſe who died in Sin might obtain Pardon, which he thought if it were true would make it unneceſſary to live vertuouſly, if they had Pious Friends who would pray for them, when they were dead; <hi>Epiphanius</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to confute <hi>Aerius,</hi> but gives ſuch Reaſons, as are no anſwer at all to his Queſtions. He ſays it ſignifies our Belief, that thoſe who are dead to this World do ſtill live in another ſtate, are alive to God; That it ſignifies our good Hopes of the Happy State of thoſe who are gone hence; That it is done to make a Diſtinction between Chriſt, and all other good Men, for we pray for all but him, who intercedes for us all.

               <p>The moſt Excellent Arch-biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> both in his Writing and Diſcourſe, acknowledged theſe Orders to be the ſame, that the difference was only in degree, that Biſhops ordained as Presbyters, but regulated the Ordination as Biſhops, and would not endure to hear the Ordination of the Reformed Churches condemned; In his Reduction of Epiſcopacy Printed by Dr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> he proves both by the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 2, 3.</note> and the Order of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that Spiritual Juriſdiction belongs to the Common Council of Presbyters, in which the Biſhop is no more than Preſident, and page 6. has theſe words. <q>True it is that in our Church this kind of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Government hath been long diſuſed, yet ſeeing it ſtill profeſſeth that every Paſtor hath a right to rule the Church, from whence the name of Rector was alſo firſt given to him, and to adminiſter the Diſcipline of Chriſt as well as to diſpenſe the Doctrine and Sacraments, and the reſtraint of the exerciſe of that Right, proceedeth only from the Cuſtom now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Realm, no man can doubt but by another Law of the Land this hindrance may be well removed.</q>

But as to the difference betwixt Biſhop and Presbyter, for as much as the Church of <hi>England</hi> is Governed by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, it is the more general opinion of the Engliſh, that Epiſcopacy and Presbytery are diſtinct offices, inſtituted by Chriſt with diſtinct powers; but the reſt of the Reformed, as alſo they of the Auguſtane Confeſſion, do unanimouſly believe that there is no ſuch diſtinction by Divine Right, but that as the names in Scripture are ſynonymous, and put for each other indifferently, ſo the thing is wholly the ſame; and that the ſuperiority of Biſhops above Presbyters, which has now for many Ages obtained in the Church, is onely of Poſitive and Eccleſiaſtical Right, and has been introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereinto by degrees. That even in the Apoſtles days, a certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of honour and place, was given unto him who did excell his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, either in Age or in the time of his Ordination, ſo that he was as Preſident or Moderator of the Presbytery, and yet look'd upon as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame office, and had no power or jurisdiction over his Colleagues, and this Perſon did always perform thoſe things,

               <q>
                  <p>But in the following Age it ſo fell out, that this Primacy was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd according to the Perſons Age or time of entrance, but a cuſtom was introduced, that one of the Presbyters ſhould be choſen by the Votes of the whole Colledge, who ſhould continually preſide after the ſame manner over the Presbytery, and theſe after a while aſſumed to themſelves the name of Biſhops, and by degrees gained more and more Prerogatives, and brought their Colleagues into ſubjection to them, till at length the matter grew up to that Tyranny, which now obtains in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover though all reformed Divines, (excepting thoſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) condemn that ſupream power, which among the Papiſts, Biſhops uſurp over Presbyters as Tyrannical, and think that by the Law of God there is no diſtinction betwixt Biſhop and Presbyter, yet is there ſome diſpute amongſt them, whether it be not expedient by Poſitive and Eccleſiaſtick ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                     <hi>An inference concerning Ordination, The Point of Succeſſion more largely debated; Our Engliſh Biſhops have no Juriſdiction, nor their Canons any power, but what is derived from the Civil Magiſtrates; who has now left us to our Liberty in the caſe of Conformity, reflections upon Mr.</hi> Norris <hi>his charge of Schiſme continued.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Will now venture to leave this point as ſufficiently proved, that Biſhops have no Power or Juriſdiction given them by the Law of God, but what Presbyters have as well as they, I have been the larger upon it, becauſe it goes a great way in deciding the whole controverſie, and would ſave me all farther Labour, about the caſes of Ordination and Succeſſion.</p>
               <p>As to Ordination, if Presbyters be the ſame with Scripture Biſhops, the Orders conferred by them muſt needs be valid, for as Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſays, 'tis a right that cannot be taken away from them by Humane Rules; it is true indeed there may be ſuch a prudent Order agreed upon, for the due ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this work, as may make it irregular to ordain without a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but ſuch agreements cannot make the action null; for my part I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew any Ordination amongſt Diffenters, but there was a Moderator choſen, who was chiefly concerned in the conduct of it, and ſuch a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator wants nothing of the Primitive Biſhop: And if there be ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Canons, that ſay the Presbyters ſhall not ordain without the Biſhop,
<note place="margin">Concil Carth. 3, 4. <hi>C.</hi> 22.</note> ſo there are others that ſay the Biſhop ſhall not ordain without the Presbyters, and by requiring Presbyters to join in this office, it is certain they have the power, otherwiſe their laying on of hands would be a meer nullity. The truth is, neither a ſingle Biſhop, nor a ſingle Presbyter can regularly Ordain, it ought to be done by a Claſſis, and in that caſe there muſt be ſome Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to avoid confuſion, and that is the general practice amongſt us, and therefore our Ordinations are not only valid, but regular too.</p>

                  <q>The Power of Order by all Writers that ever I could ſee, even of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is underſtood to be immediately from Chriſt, given to all Biſhops and Prieſts alike by their Conſecration;</q> And it is very conſiderable, what Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> mentions, concerning Arch-biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi>'s Opinion in this caſe,
<note place="margin">The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the late A.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93151:28"/>Biſhop, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Dr. <hi>Bancroft,</hi> who was preſent, maintained, That there was no neceſſity for it, ſeeing where Biſhops could not be had, Ordination by Presbyters muſt be eſteemed lawful, otherwiſe it might be doubted whether there were any lawful vocation in moſt of the Reformed Churches: this was applauded by the other Biſhops, and <hi>Ely</hi> acquieſced in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It was too great a hardſhip therefore that our Biſhops put upon the poor baniſhed Miniſters of the French Churches, in requiring them to be re-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, which in the ſence of the impoſers, was a renouncing the validity of their former Ordination, and it is very remarkable that ſome of thoſe that were moſt zealous in that ſevere uſage of thoſe poor Refugees, and would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit none to be Miniſters that did not ſubmit to them in it, are ſince diveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their Epiſcopal power themſelves, and have now time to conſider, whether to allow the Ordinations of the Roman Churches, and reject thoſe of the Reformed, was not (to uſe Monſieur <hi>Claudes</hi> words) a piece of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaiſme all over, that ſtrains at a Gnat and ſwallows a Camel.</p>
               <p>And for the pretended Succeſſion, if our Presbyters which have Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Ordination (and I know no other) be really Biſhops by the Laws and Language of Scripture, We are in the Line ſtill (as the Vindicator ſpeaks) if ſuch a Line there be: though we look upon it as a moſt wretched piece of confidence and madneſs, to make the Eſſence of the Miniſtry and Church depend upon a thing ſo lubricous and uncertain.</p>
               <p>But that we may if it be poſſible lead this Man out of his fooliſh conceit, about the neceſſity of an un-interrupted Line of Succeſſion from the Apoſtles, let us but ſtate the caſe according to his own aſſertions, and perhaps when it is rightly put it will not require much arguing; His opinion in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, take in theſe three points.</p>
               <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">Arch-Rebel, <hi>p.</hi> 2, 3.</note> He affirms that the Biſhops receive their Spiritual Juriſdiction from the Apoſtles, by the Line of Succeſſion, this Succeſſion he makes the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Title and Power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From hence he infers, that he is no true Biſhop, who is not ordained by another Biſhop, and ſo upwards in a continued line of Epiſcopal Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Apoſtles themſelves;
<note place="margin">Arch-Rebel, <hi>p.</hi> 3.</note> ſo that if a Man could ſhew a Spiritual Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree in a Line of Epiſcopacy for a thouſand years, yet if ſo long ago there was failure, he is but a Lay Impoſtor. And</p>
               <p n="3">3. That thoſe Churches (or what you'll pleaſe to call them) that are not under the Government of ſuch Biſhops,
<note place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 18.</note> as are poſſeſs't of their Authority, by ſuch a Line, are out of the Communion of the Catholick Church, have no Miniſtry, no Sacraments, no Salvation.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe, that Biſhops have their power from the Apoſtles as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Succeſſors,
<note place="margin">P. 20.</note> will certainly infer, that they could never be poſſeſſed of it till the Apoſtles were dead, unleſs we can ſuppoſe that they were degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or voluntarily reſigned; this the Vindicator has deſervedly expoſed, <q>To be the Apoſtles Succeſſors in Apoſtolical power, the Apoſtles ſtill liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93151:28"/>and in Plenitude of Power, is a very great Myſtery, and ſomething like the honeſt Vicar of <hi>N</hi>'s Prayer for King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. that he might outlive all his Succeſſors;</q> What has the Gentleman to reply to this? He puts on a marvellous grave aſpect, and charges the Vindicator with Scoffing at <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> but this is a poor ſhift of his own, when he has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf ridiculous, to turn it off to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> I do not believe there is any ſuch Affinity or Line of Succeſſion betwixt thoſe bleſſed Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and this Gentleman, but a man may venture to expoſe the folly of the latter, and ſtill preſerve a due Veneration for the former.</p>
               <p>He confeſſes it was a piece of Ignorance to pray that the King might out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live all his Succeſſors, and why then is not he as ignorant in ſaying that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>Linus,</hi> were made the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles in their Apoſtolical Power, whilſt the Apoſtles were ſtill living, for in this caſe, the Apoſtles might have outlived their Succeſſors, and if we believe ſome Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians they did ſo; and if this be ignorance in the Vicar, it can be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary piece of Wiſdom and Illumination in the Citizen; he confeſſes this is a myſtery, and ſo he ſays is all the Goſpel, but he muſt not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to obtrude ſuch ſtuff of his own upon the World, becauſe the Goſpel is a myſtery, thanks be to God, a man may eaſily diſcern, betwixt the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel, and thoſe of <hi>T. W's</hi> making.</p>
               <p>But if this Notion won't paſs under the pretence of Myſtery, he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a reaſon for it, which we have in theſe Words, <q>They could not have been ſaid to be Succeſſors of Apoſtolical Power, if the Apoſtles whilſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had not conferr'd it upon them, could the Apoſtles have ordained then after they were dead?</q> No truly, no more than give Scripture Rules af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were dead; but were all that the Apoſtles ordained their Succeſſors in Apoſtolical Power, then the Presbyters which they ordained muſt be ſo too; He ſays, <hi>The Apoſtle by ordaining them in his Life-time, ſecured the Succeſſion to them, and the Government too in the Apoſtles abſence:</hi> But I wiſh he had told us how they could ſecure the Succeſſion to them, unleſs they could have ſecured them from dying before them; and for ſecuring the Government to them in the Apoſtles abſence, that was no more than what they did for the Presbyters, but if they were inveſted in Apoſtolical Power, they had enjoyed the Government as much in the Apoſtles Preſence, as in their Abſence, for the Apoſtles had all the ſame Power, and had it alike whether together or aſunder; In ſhort, if it be really true, that the Biſhops muſt either be the Apoſtles Succeſſors in Apoſtolical Power, whilſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles lived, or they could never be ſo, we muſt conclude, they could never be ſo, for whilſt the Apoſtles lived, they could not have Succeſſors in their Office, eſpecially ſuch as claimed their Power by ſuch Succeſſion.</p>

Is it come to this at laſt, that we have nothing certain but what we have in the Scriptures? Are all the outcries of Apoſtolical Tradition, of Perſonal Succeſſion, of Unqueſtionable Records, reſolved at laſt into Scripture it ſelf, by him, from whom all theſe Pedigrees are fetched? Then let Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion know its place, and vail Bonnet to the Scriptures, and withal let men take heed of over-reaching themſelves when they would bring down ſo large a Catalogue of ſingle Biſhops from the firſt and pureſt times of the Church, for it will be hard for others to believe them, when <hi>Euſebius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth it is ſo hard to find them.</q>

               <p>There are two things to be done, before a man can prove this uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Line; firſt, He muſt have a true Catalogue of the Names of all ſuch Biſhops as have filled the See, and then he muſt be able to demonſtrate that none of them, came in after a Surreptitious manner without Epiſcopal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; the former is difficult, but the latter much harder, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, the former will amount to no more than a Wild-gooſe row of hard Words and Names.</p>

This Story St. <hi>Jerome</hi> likewiſe tells us, and by it proves the Identity of Biſhops and Presbyters, and that Presbyters have not only Power to ordain thoſe of the ſame degree with themſelves, but to conſecrate Patriarchs too.</p>
               <p>And this Aſſertion undoes all the Reformed Churches abroad that are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Presbyters; To this the Gentleman replies, That many very Learned and Pious Perſons amongſt them, have declared their longing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for the Epiſcopacy, but living in Popiſh Dominions, cannot have any but thoſe of the Popiſh Communion, or in Republicks that will not admit of Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:93151:31"/>
               <p>But are deſires then of Epiſcopacy ſufficient to bring a Man within Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion? What then becomes of the Abſolute neceſſity of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Succeſſion, if affectionate Deſires after this Communion will free a Man from Schiſm? Then ſurely Schiſm lies in the want of ſuch Deſires, which comes nearer to Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Notion than this Gentleman I ſuppoſe was aware of; but after all (though 'tis pity to put him out of a good humour, ſince he happens ſo ſeldom into it) if there be no Catholick Communion without Epiſcopacy, and without ſuch Communion, our hopes for Salvation are but Fancies, as this Gentleman tells us; Deſires after Epiſcopacy will not relieve Men, it will only prove that they deſire ſuch Communion, and to be in the way of Salvation, but that at preſent they are not ſo.</p>
               <p>And I wonder how it does appear that the Reformed Churches deſire this Dioceſan Epiſcopacy; by what Publick Acts do they declare any ſuch Deſires? What their Thoughts are concerning it we have already ſeen: It may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (as the Honourable Mr.

                  <hi>Fines</hi> once replied in Parliament to this very thing) there are ſome amongſt them that deſire Epiſcopacy, that is, the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Revenues of Biſhops, but that any deſire Epiſcopacy as the fitteſt and beſt Government of the Church, I do not believe; for if they would have Biſhops, I know not what hindreth but they may; they have Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and Synods, and National Aſſemblies, and Moderators therein, and how eaſily might theſe be made Biſhops? <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> are Popiſh Countries, and yet they have Superintendents or Biſhops; And why will not Republicks admit Epiſcopacy? Is it becauſe they have found it injurious to the Commonwealth? Methinks that is no great Commendation of the Order, or will they ſay it does not ſo well comport with that Form of Government? That is a ſign it is not of Divine Inſtitution; for, as God will have Goſpel-Churches in all Countries, ſo he has put nothing into their Conſtitution, but what will conſiſt with any form of Civil Polity, and has not obliged Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican States to become Monarchies, in order to their reception of the Goſpel. I know nothing the Church has to do with Civil Conſtitutions, nor will I ever be of that Eccleſiaſtical Communion which cannot ſubſiſt in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths as well as in Monarchies, but muſt overturn Publick Conſtitutions to make room for its own Settlement.</p>
               <p>And as this Doctrine overturns the Primitive, and the Reformed Churches; ſo this Gentleman knows not how great a ſhock he has given his own by it: For Hiſtorians tell us, that thoſe Famous Biſhops who were inſtrumental in Converting ſo many in the Northern Parts of our Iſland to Chriſtianity, were ordained by the Abbot of <hi>Hye,</hi> who was only a Presbyter; and who knows how far the Line of thoſe Biſhops reaches. To this, the Gentleman has made ſome reply, telling us,

                  <hi>Sherlock,</hi> wiſely declines diſputing the matter of fact concerning this Abbots Ordination of Biſhops, and fairly grants that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> allows the Ordinations of Abbots Soveraign, which are but Presbyters, to be both valid and regular, but ſays ſuch Ordinations were an incroachment upon the Epiſcopal Authority, and void in themſelves, which I ſhall not now queſtion, it being ſufficient and indeed only proper to my preſent purpoſe to ſhew that Abbots did Ordain, and were allowed to do it by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and if ſuch orders be void then the Epiſcopal Line is broken.</p>
               <p>And who can forbear declaiming againſt the wretched folly of Men of ſuch principles, that will thus unſettle the foundations of their own Churches, that they may overturn others, and like the Executioners of the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will venture a burning themſelves, that they may be ſure to throw others far enough into the fiery Furnace.</p>
               <p>Let us hear how this Gentleman will demonſtrate this uninterrupted Line of Succeſſion, for He ought to make it as clear as any Article of his Creed, there being none more eſſential to Salvation according to his own account of it. And he tells us, <q>The very neceſſity of ſuch a Line is a ſufficient reaſon to prove it, no man can be Miniſter of the Goſpel that is not ſent, no man has power to ſend, who hath not received it by Succeſſion from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;</q> That is to ſay, it is ſo, becauſe it muſt be ſo; and it muſt be ſo, becauſe it is abſolutely neceſſary it ſhould be ſo; and if this be not proof ſufficient, we muſt go to thoſe that can give us better. But,</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:93151:32"/>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Why does he not prove that thore can be no true miſſion without ſuch a Line? we cannot give him credit in a matter of ſuch value, and though he repeat it a thouſand times, we will not regard it, till we ſee it proved; We do verily believe with the reſt of the Reformed Churches, that where-ever the <hi>Coetus Fidelium</hi> is, there lies an inherent fundamental right of chuſing, and calling perſons to the Miniſtry, though this is moſt regularly exerciſed by thoſe that are already Paſtors, and ought not to be done by others where ſuch may conveniently be had; but all the World beſides the Papiſts and a few odd Bigotted perſons in our own Nation, diſtinguiſh betwixt an irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and a nullity, and we believe that both Sacred and Civil Societies agree in this, which is founded upon the eſſence, and common principles of all Societies as ſuch, that they have a latent power to elect and inveſt their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, though by Cuſtom, or the Laws of the Community, the exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be conſigned to a particular Order of Men amongſt them.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Prejudices challenges Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> to produce any Texts of Scripture, that give Lay-Men a right to ordain Miniſters in any caſe; to which he replies, <q>This demand is but a vain wrangling,
<note place="margin">Defence of the Reform. <hi>P.</hi> IV. <hi>p.</hi> 94, 95.</note> for when Scripture recommends to the Faithful, the taking diligent heed to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and confirmation of their Faith, and to propagate it to their Children, it gives them by that very thing a ſufficient right to make uſe of all proper means in order to that end; and every body knows the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is one of thoſe means, and therefore the obligation the faithful are under to preſerve and propagate the Faith, includes that of <hi>Creating</hi> to themſelves Paſtors when they cannot have them otherwiſe; in ſhort when the Scripture teaches that the faithful have a right to chuſe their Paſtors, it teaches thereby that they have a right to inſtal them into their Office in caſe of neceſſity, for that call conſiſting much more eſſentially in Election than in inſtallation, which is but a formality, there is no reaſon to believe that God would have given the People a Right to chuſe their Paſtors, and to have them inſtalled by others, and that he has not given them at the ſame time a power of inſtalling them themſelves, when it cannot be done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſince naturally that which we have a right to do by another, we have a right to do by our ſelves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, what if not onely Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> but Monſieur <hi>Dodwell</hi> too, that ſpeaking head of our high-flown Clergy, acknowledges ſuch a right in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Societies of chuſing and inveſting their Officers? No matter whether it be reconcileable with the other parts of his Scheme or no:

                     <hi>Dodwel</hi> Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. of Churches p. 102. P. 52.</note> In his Separation of Churches he ſpeaks to this purpoſe. <q>The Church with whom God has made the Covenant, is a Body Politick, though not a Civil one, and God has deſigned all perſons to enter into this Society; — It is ſufficient for my purpoſe that the Eccleſiaſtical Power be no otherwiſe from God, than that is of every ſupream Civil Magiſtrate; it is not uſual for Kings to be inveſted into their Offices by other Kings, but by their Subjects, yet when they are inveſted that doth not in the leaſt prejudice the abſoluteneſs of their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93151:33"/>Monarchy, where the Fundamental Conſtitutions of the reſpective places allow it to them, much leſs doth it give any power over them to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by whom they are inveſted; If the power of Epiſcopacy be Divine, all that men can do in the caſe, is onely to determine the perſon, not to confine his power — no act can be preſumed to be the act of the whole Body,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 509.</note> but what has paſſed them in their publick Aſſemblies (in which Body is the Right of Government.) — As nothing but the Society it ſelf can make a valid conveyance of its right, ſo it is not conceivable, how the Society can do it by any thing but its own Act — And when ever a perſon is inveſted into the Supream Power,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 522.</note> and the Society over which he is placed, is independant on other Societies, ſuch a perſon can never be placed in his power, if not by them who muſt after be his ſubjects, unleſs by his Predeceſſor, which no Society can depend upon for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Rule of Succeſſion. — I am apt to think this muſt have been the way of making Biſhops at firſt, how abſolute ſoever I conceive them to be when they are once made — This ſeems beſt to agree with the abſoluteneſs of particular Churches,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 523.</note> before they had by compact united themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Metropolitans and Exarchs, into Provincial, and Dioceſan Churches; And this ſeems to have been fitted for the frequent perſecutions of thoſe earlier Ages, when every Church was able to ſecure its own ſucceſſion, without depending on the uncertain opportunities of the meeting of the Biſhops of the whole Province; And the alteration of this practice, the giving the Biſhops of the Province an intereſt in the choice of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Colleague, ſeems not to have been ſo much for want of power in the particular Churches to do it, as for the ſecurity of compacts that they might be certain of ſuch a Colleague as would obſerve them — It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that it was in imitation of the Philoſophers Succeſſions, that theſe Eccleſiaſtical Succeſſions were framed, and when the Philoſophers failed to nominate their own Succeſſors, the Election was in the Schools.</q> Theſe are his words, and they are too plain to need a Comment: If every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church had Originally a power within it ſelf to chuſe and inveſt its Biſhop, and the concurrence of other Biſhops herein was not for want of Power in that particular Church, but only for ſecuring the agreement of Biſhops amongſt themſelves, We have done with the neceſſity of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Line of Epiſcopal Ordinations, and there may be true miſsion without it, <hi>quod erat probandum.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, Should we grant that there is a neceſsity of an uninterrupted Line, and that this, as he learnedly ſpeaks, is a ſufficient proof that there is ſuch a Line, yet it muſt be conſidered, this neceſsity will onely prove that there muſt be ſome Biſhops and Churches that are in the Line, but it will not prove that they are all ſo, nor that it is the caſe of thoſe amongſt us; for though we may ſuppoſe that God has had a true Miniſtry in all Ages, and will have, that will not demonſtrate that he hath ſuch in <hi>England,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prove the Miniſtry of the Engliſh Churches true, he muſt have ſome
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93151:33"/>better Evidence than the neceſsity of ſuch a Line which will onely prove it is ſomewhere, not that it is amongſt us; and it is but ſmall ſatisfaction to us, to know that there is a true Miniſtry ſome where in the World, but no man in the World can tell where it is; By this Gentlemans way of reaſoning the Papiſts pretend to prove the Infallibility of their Church, firſt they ſuppoſe the neceſsity of an Infallible Judge, and then take it for granted that this Judge is to be found amongſt them, and truly <hi>Arcades ambo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Vindicator put a queſtion to him, and we ſhould be glad of a better anſwer than he has yet thought fit to give us; <q>He deſired <hi>T. W.</hi> to tell him whether this Line of Succeſsion might be continued in a Schiſmatical Church, for if by Schiſm Men and Societies are cut off from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church as this Man affirms, ſuch Schiſmatical Churches are indeed no Churches, no parts of the Univerſal Church, and ſo cannot be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Apoſtolical Power; and if this Power cannot be derived through a Schiſmatical Church, then muſt he grant, either that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has not this Power, or that the Papal Churches through which it runs are not Schiſmatical; and if they be not, his own Church muſt be ſo in ſeparating from them,</q> for he holds ſeparation to be utterly unlawful, unleſs it be from a Schiſmatical Church.</p>
               <p>His anſwer to this, ſuch as it is, you have in the 23 page of his reply, in theſe words. <q>I cannot underſtand his Logick in this, if by Schiſm Men and Societies are cut off from the Univerſal Church, then ſuch Schiſmatical Churches are no Churches.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But is not the conſequence as plain as can be, if Schiſm cut Men and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties off from the Univerſal Church, then ſuch Schiſmatical Societies are no Churches? Can they be Churches, and yet cut off from the Univerſal Church? Can they be cut off by Schiſm, and ſtill united to it? He that does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Logick of this, does not underſtand the Logick of Common Senſe; but has he nothing farther to reply? Yes he ſays, <hi>Churches they are, though Schiſmatical, while they retain the Apoſtolical Succeſſion.</hi> But the Queſtion is, whether Schiſmatical Churches can retain the Apoſtolical Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion? Since by Schiſm he ſays they are cut off from the Catholick Church, and ſo Unchurched; theſe things will require a ſecond reading, and a more direct reply, and that I may provoke him to do it, I ſhall lay the caſe before him, in theſe three points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If any Schiſmatical Societies may ſtill remain Churches, then Schiſm as ſuch, does not cut Men and Societies off from the Unity of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and then the whole thread of his diſcourſe is ſpoiled, which every where makes Schiſm to be Separation from the Communion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, out of which he ſays truly there is no true Miniſtry, nor Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If all Schiſmatical Societies are Unchurched, then either they loſe the Apoſtolical Succeſsion and Power, or elſe there may be Apoſtolical Power where there is no Church; And it would be very ſtrange to find a Power to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93151:34"/>Ordain and to Adminiſter Sacraments in Societies, where there can be no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry nor Sacraments; Church Power without a Church, a Right to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Church by Apoſtolical Succeſsion, and yet no Right to the Church or any of its Priviledges; The power which is an adjunct, without the Church which is its Subject; Theſe are myſteries which I am no more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to underſtand, than that of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Papal Churches through which this Power is conveyed be not Schiſmatical, then he makes the Founders of his own Church ſo, for he ſays, There's no way of holding Communion with the Univerſal Church,
<note place="margin">Arch-Rebel, <hi>p.</hi> 6.</note> but by holding Communion with the Particular Churches we live amongſt, if they be not Schiſmatical.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of ſpeaking plainly to theſe things, he asks us whether Re-ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that come over from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Reformed, was ever required? We anſwer No, and can give a good reaſon for it upon our Principles, but it will be hard to do ſo upon his: We do not think the validity of the Miniſtry depends upon ſuch Line, nor do we believe that either Schiſm or Hereſie, as ſuch, do utterly deſtroy their Church ſtate, indeed a renunciation of any of the fundamental Articles of our Faith would do it; but every hereſie will not: We believe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be both Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and Heretical, but do not therefore ſay their Church ſtate is utterly loſt, though greatly corrupted, for then it would be hard to allow their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, eſpecially if we thought Ordination ſo neceſſary, and that the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity thereof depended upon the Adminiſtrators, as this Gentleman affirms.</p>
               <p>Therefore where he ſays the Vindicator attempts to unchurch the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe our Biſhops derive their conſecration from <hi>Rome,</hi> he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly miſtakes himſelf, the Vindicator ſpoke <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and only ſhewed him what would be the conſequence of his own arguing.</p>
               <p>He tells us <hi>It is the Judgement of all Reformed Divines, that formal Schiſm can never invalidate the power of formal and regular Ordination.</hi> But if thoſe Reformed Divines thought as be, that formal Schiſm utterly excludes out of the Catholick Church, they muſt needs acknowledge that where there is formal Schiſm, there can be no ſuch things as regular Ordination; and 'tis ſtrange this Gentleman, that makes Schiſm ſuch an unchurching thing, ſhall talk of a regular Ordination in a formal Schiſm; one would think the regularity would have been ſpoiled, if the Eſſence thereof ſhould happily eſcape,
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> Vindic. of Prot. Princ. <hi>p.</hi> 107, 108.</note> (And yet ſome of our Doctor, make this the very reaſon why the Diſſenters Ordinations are Null, becauſe they ordain in a Schiſm, granting that in caſe of neceſsity they may do it.) But as to the Reformed Divines, if they allow the Ordination of Schiſmaticks to be valid, it is either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think the validity of the Orders, does not depend upon the quall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of the perſon conferring there, or that Schiſm does not neceſſarily exclude a Perſon or People out of the Communion of the Catholick Church; and here lies this Gentlemans Error, he would tack the candid concluſion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93151:34"/>formed Churches, to the unmerciful Premiſes of his own, but they will by no means comport.</p>
               <p>This Notion of the Neceſſity of an uninterrupted Line of Succeſſion for the conveyance of Power, like Water by Pipes and Conduits, the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator made bold to call a Whimſie, which has exceedingly raiſed the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans Spleen; <hi>A Whimſie (ſays he,) that's ſome Phantaſtick device, or the Creature of an unſt able unſettled Brain, which being applied to Prelates that bear the Authority of Chriſt can be no leſs than Blaſphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Vindicator never charged this Whimſie upon the Prelates, the greateſt part of whom I dare ſay will not thank this man for hanging their Authority upon ſo ſlender a thread; 'tis his own Whimſie, and ſo ſilly a one that we will never charge it on any that do not expreſly own it; and yet if a Man ſhould venture to ſay of ſome Prelates, that they are unſtable and their Brains unſettled (as namely the late Biſhops of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Ely, &amp;c.</hi>) I know not how it can be proved Blaſphemy, nor will any man call it ſo that has not made an Idol of the Mitre, or the Head that wears it, unleſs theſe clamours proceed from the ſame Principle with thoſe of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> who were as tender of their <hi>Diana,</hi> as theſe men are of the Hierarchy and this Image of Succeſſion that dropt down from <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all we have ſaid againſt the Neceſſity of ſuch a Line, yet if this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman or any for him will clear it, we will have as much Benefit by it as himſelf, having largely proved that Presbyters are the ſame with Biſhops by the Law of God, and therefore our Ordinations are as valid as theirs, but we will never ſo far betray, the Honour of the Church, nor the Peace of mens Conſciences, as to make all depend upon that which is impoſſible to be proved; and certainly if it be a thing of that conſequence this Gentleman makes it, the proof ſhould be as ſtrong and clear as that of the moſt eſſential Doctrines of our Religion; and to ſay as Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> is forced at laſt that a Preſumptive Title may ſerve, is to unſay all, and to confeſs that it is not the reality of ſuch a Line on which the Power depends, but the ſtrong Conceit and Preſumption of men, which is the worſt Baſis that Epiſcopacy has ever yet been fixed upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing in our Plea, is, That the whole Juriſdiction of our Engliſh Biſhops, and the Power of their Canons is derived from the Civil Magiſtrate and Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p>And this I think will follow from the former, if this Prelatical Power be not from the Laws of God, it muſt be from the Laws of the Land.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93151:35"/>entire Epiſcopacy with all the Rights and Powers of it to any one Biſhop. If Biſhops <hi>or Presbyters</hi> will not exerciſe that Power, which God has given them they are accountable to their Lord for it, but they cannot give it away, neither from themſelves nor from their Succeſſors, for it is theirs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to uſe, not to part with, and therefore every Biſhop <hi>or Presbyter</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume ſuch Rights, though a General Council ſhould give them away, becauſe the Grant is void in it ſelf.</q>

               <p>Nothing will ſet this matter in a better Light than our Acts of Parliament, eſpecially that of the 37. <hi>Hen</hi> 8.

               <p>The Civil Magiſtrate may multiply Biſhops <hi>ad libitum,</hi> and if he pleaſes may appoint one in every Pariſh; by the Statute of 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. <hi>c.</hi> 14. Six and twenty Suffragan Biſhops are added to the Dioceſans, as (ſaith the Act) hath been accuſtomed to be in this Realm, the Arch-Biſhop or Biſhop was to name two, whereof the King to chuſe one, and to give him the Name Title and Dignity of Biſhop, and to that Name, Title and Dignity, the Arch Biſhop with two Biſhops or Suffragans more, is to conſecrate him, onely he is to act by the Commiſſion of the Dioceſan, and to have none of the profits of the Biſhoprick; this reſtraint in the exerciſe might have been taken off, if the Legiſlative Power had ſo pleaſed; And if this Law had not given them the Epiſcopal Power, they could not have exerciſed that Power, by any Commiſsion from the Dioceſan whatſoever.</p>
               <p>He may alſo delegate the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction to whom he pleaſes, either to Lay-Men or to Presbyters; 'Tis commonly aſſigned to Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, they do judicially Excommunicate and Abſolve, and they have their Commiſſion to do it, from the King, not from the Biſhop; and in ſome places the Epiſcopal Juriſdiction is reſerved to a Presbyter, as in the Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars, we have in divers parts of <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>Bridgnorth</hi> ſix Pariſhes are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a Court held by a Presbyter; and <hi>Godolphin</hi> tells us, there are certain peculiar Juriſdictions, belonging to ſome certain Pariſhes, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants whereof are exempted from the Arch-Deacons, and ſometimes from the Biſhops Juriſdiction, of which there are fifty ſeven in the Province of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93151:37"/>
                  <hi>Canterbury;</hi> A certain proof that the Biſhops Juriſdiction is only by humane Right or Cuſtom, becauſe the Law can exempt ſome Pariſhes from it; but by the Citizen of <hi>Cheſters</hi> Divinity, all theſe peculiars have the peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of being unchurched, and their exemption would be tantamount to Excommunication, becauſe they are not under the Government of the Biſhop, without which there can be no Church Unity; If any ſay, they are under the Archiepiſcopal Juriſdiction, I anſwer, they are no otherwiſe under it than the Biſhops are, and the Prelatical party themſelves acknowledge that Arch-Biſhops are but of Humane Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Civil Magiſtrate may alſo depoſe and deprive Biſhops when they ſee juſt cauſe; and this power has been ſo lately exerted, that it needs no farther proof; I would fain know whether the deprived Biſhops be not diveſted of all Epiſcopal Juriſdiction; Perhaps this will be thought an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious queſtion, and an inſulting over the misfortunes of thoſe learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, but I profeſs ſeriouſly, it is not ſpoken in any ſuch Humour; Men of Tender Conſciences though under a miſtake, will conciliate veneration from others; The worſt I wiſh them is, that God would ſhew them the evil of their former impoſitions upon the Conſciences of their poor deſpiſed Brethren; But that which induces me to mention it is, I find the Defenders of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy confidently aſſert, that there can be but one Biſhop in one Church at the ſame time, therefore if the former be not diveſted of their power, I ſee not how the preſent Incumbents can have any by their own Rule, and ſo their Ordinations would be Null, if the others be ſtill valid; The preſent Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> in his debate with Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> ſays it was the Inviolable Rule of the Church, to have but one Biſhop in a City and Church at once, and Dr. <hi>Morrice</hi> labours hard to conquer Mr. <hi>Clarkſons</hi> objection againſt it, which was,
<note place="margin">Def. of the Anſ. to Dr. <hi>St. p.</hi> 19.</note> That <hi>Alexander</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> whilſt <hi>Narciſſus</hi> lived: He ſays <hi>Narciſſus</hi> took <hi>Alexander</hi> into the participation of the charge, but foreſeeing that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> would reply, then here were two Biſhops jointly governing one Church, contrary to Dr. <hi>St's.</hi> inviolable Rule, he adds <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> was the Biſhop, <hi>Narciſſus</hi> retained but the Name and Title onely, that is, was but a Titular, not a real Biſhop, and it ſeems that was his part of the Charge, to have onely the Title and no Charge at all. Now whether <hi>T.W.</hi> thinks the late Biſhops are the Titular and the preſent the Real, or on the contrary, we will not oblige him to declare, onely we gueſs at his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, by his calling the Late Arch-Biſhop the Ruler of Gods People, above half a year after he was deprived.</p>
               <p>Perhaps this Gentleman will ſatisfie himſelf with ſaying, the late Prelates have the power ſtill, but are reſtrained from the exerciſe of it. But that would be to confront the Act of Parliament, which ſays expreſsly they are deprived of their Office, and diſtinguiſhes betwixt being ſuſpended from the exerciſe of their Office, and being deprived of the Office it ſelf, if they did not take the Oaths before the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>

                  <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deprived, and are hereby judged to be deprived of their Offices, Benefices, Dignities and Promotions Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
               <p>What is it then that the Civil Magiſtrate may not do in the making of an Engliſh Prelate? I know it will be ſaid he cannot conſecrate him, and it is the Conſecration that gives the Epiſcopal power, but to this I have two things to return.</p>
               <p n="1">1. According to their own Practice, Epiſcopal Juriſdiction is exerciſed by perſons never ſo conſecrated, as by Presbyters and Lay-Chancellors in the caſes before mentioned, and they have Authority given them to exerciſe that Juriſdiction, and that not by Deputation from the Biſhop, but by Legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and what is the Office of a Biſhop, but Authority to do the work of a Biſhop?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since the whole Being of Epiſcopal power, is founded upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, it is very reaſonable to demand from them a plain Rule in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for this Conſecration of Biſhops, as diſtinct from the Ordination of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; If they chuſe this Foot to fix their Divine Right upon, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a clear Scripture Canon ſhould be produced for it, but it is moſt certain they may turn over all the Leaves of their Bible, all the Days of their Life, before they can find any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>And as the Scripture is altogether ſilent as to the difference betwixt the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of a Presbyter and Conſecration of a Biſhop,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tit.</hi>
                  </note> (nay in the Rule for Ordination makes them the ſame) ſo this Ceremony of Conſecration has not been at all times and all caſes thought neceſſary,
<note place="margin">Repertor. Canon <hi>p.</hi> 49.</note> or practiſed in the making of Biſhops; <hi>Godolphin</hi> tells us that antiently according to the Canon Law, and where the Popes Spiritual Power and Authority was in force, Biſhops were not ſo much by Election as Poſtulation,

Pan.</hi> 2. p. 106.</note> and in that caſe the Elected was a Biſhop preſently, without Confirmation or Conſecration, onely by the aſſent of the Superiour; And I have recited already the judgment of Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> that every particular Church had a Power to inveſt its Biſhop, and that the calling in the aſſiſtance of other Biſhops, was not for want of a right in themſelves to do it; I hope theſe Gentlemen will be more cautious how they lay the whole weight of Epiſcopal Authority upon Conſecration, which it ſeems might ſometimes be omitted, leſt thereby they break their Line, and the neck of their cauſe together.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter I think it is clear enough that the Engliſh Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a meer Creature of the Civil Magiſtrate, who may make every Parſon of a Pariſh a Biſhop if he pleaſes, their whole power (as diſtinct from Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters) being founded upon the Laws of the Land, by the Statute 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. 19. it is declared <hi>That none of the Clergy ſhall from thenceforth preſume to attempt, alleadge, claim, or put in ure, any Conſtitutions or Ordinances, Provincial, or any other Canons, Nor ſhall Enact, Promulge, or Execute any ſuch Canons, Conſtitutions or Ordinances Provincial, by whatſoever name or names they ſhall be called in their Convocations in time coming (which ſhall always be aſſembled by the Authority of the Kings Writt) unleſs the ſame Clergy may

               <p n="4">4. Laſtly; We plead that the Civil Power has now left us to our Liberty in the caſe of Conformity, and therefore we are not guilty of Diſobedience to Authority in what we do.</p>
               <p>I know it will preſently be replied, That the Act of Liberty only frees Diſſenters from the Penalty of the Law, not from the Precept of it; and <q>there is a ſharp thing written (it ſeems) by Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> to prove that the only Change made by the Toleration (as he calls it) is, that the Penal part of the Law is for the preſent laid aſide,
<note place="margin">Charge of Schiſm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</note> as for the Preceptive part, that ſtands where it did, and obliges under ſin, though not under Civil Penalty, and that Diſſenters are not hereby excuſed from Diſobedience to the State, though they be not accountable to the Law for their Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity:</q> This (as far as I can learn by his Book) he grounds upon theſe two Suppoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our preſent Liberty extends no farther, than to the removing the Sanction of the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the taking away of the Sanction, does not take away the whole Obligation of the Law: And having very civilly arraigned the Government, as doing that which it ought not to do,
<note place="margin">P. 24, 32.</note> in granting this Liberty, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, I know not what ill Conſequences to the Nation and general Intereſt of Religion, which time will ſhew: He concludes with a very great Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon himſelf, that he believes the Argument has ſuffered no damage by the Management of it, and that he has ſo broken the Neck of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Objection,
<note place="margin">P. 78.</note> that he had need to be a skilful Artiſt that ſhall ſet it again.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs this is enough to diſcourage a man from medling, that is conſcious to himſelf, how little skill he has in ſetting broken Necks; but however, we will venture to examine the matter, and if there ſhould chance to be no ſuch mortal blow given, the leſs skill will ſerve to ſet all right again.</p>
               <p>I could wiſh the Gentleman had beſtowed a little more pains to make the firſt Point good; for the Queſtion is not, what Toleration ſignifies in the ſtrict, or forenſick ſenſe of the word, nor what <hi>Suarez</hi> ſays, nor how he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticizes, or diſtinguiſhes of it; for the words of the Statute are to be our Rule in diſcovering the Extent and Effects of it, and not the critical meaning of the word Toleration, which we have nothing to do with, being a word not to be found in the Act of Liberty from the beginning to the end of it;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93151:38"/>and to lay the ſtreſs of his Argument upon a bare word, which is not in the Statute, is ſo grand an impertinency as one would not have expected from Mr. <hi>Norris;</hi> and whatever his Admirers may ſay of this kind of Arguing, I am ſure the Lawyers will think it receives ſome damage in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>He tells us, Where there is an Eſtabliſht National Church, all that To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration can do, is only to remove the Penalty,
<note place="margin">P. 15.</note> and it cannot there be a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Allowance, but only of Impunity: But what if the very Act it ſelf expreſly ſays it is an Allowance? why then, either there may be an Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to diſſent from an Eſtabliſht Church, or elſe this Act of Allowance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Eſtabliſhment; let him take whether of theſe Conſequences he pleaſes, it is all one to me. The words of the Act are, <q>Provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that no Congregation or Aſſembly for Religious Worſhip ſhall be permitted or allowed by this Act until the place of ſuch Meeting ſhall be certified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Here the Law ſays, ſuch Aſſemblies ſo certified are allowed by this Act. Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> ſays, they are not allowed, I hope he will not be diſpleaſed, if we believe thoſe favourable words of the Law, rather than his unkind contradiction.</p>
               <p>But he ſays, It cannot be an Allowance, and yet if it be ſo, it can be ſo; and let him argue the Notional impoſſibility as long as he pleaſes, whilſt we have the plain words of the Statute, and matter of fact to the contrary; but, ſays he, if it be an Allowance, the National Church is not Eſtabliſht, why then it is not Eſtabliſht, for an Allowance it is, if we may believe the words of the Law; and if this Act of Allowance have deſtroyed the former Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, who can help it? And yet I ſee no reaſon why the Church of <hi>England</hi> may not be Eſtabliſh'd, and Nonconformity allowed too, unleſs by Eſtabliſhment ſomething more be meant, than that word can neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: Indeed if by Eſtabliſhment he mean a direct poſitive Command, to Worſhip God according to the Mode of the Epiſcopal Party; I grant it cannot well conſiſt with an Allowance to Worſhip him otherwiſe; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Law is not to be ſet at variance with it ſelf, it has but one Voice, and ſpeaks diſtinctly and conſiſtently, and therefore if former Laws have ſaid, We command you all to Worſhip God after this manner, and a latter Law ſays, We allow you to Worſhip God after another manner, it is plain the laſt is the preſent Voice of the Law, ſignifying that it is not its deſign to tye us up to that particular Mode, and that former Command which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the Eſtabliſhment, cannot diſannul the Allowance which comes after; but if they cannot conſiſt together, the former muſt be vacated by the latter.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> has ſtill a Legal Eſtabliſhment, that is to ſay, ſhe has great Priviledges, large Revenues, the Publick Places of Worſhip, and thoſe ſhe has by Law; but, as Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> tells us, All that Toleration can do where there is an Eſtabliſhment, is to remove the Penalty: So we may reply, All that Eſtabliſhment can do or ſignifie, where there is an Act of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93151:39"/>Allowance, is only to confer ſuch outward Priviledges; and as the removal of the Penal Sanction does not always aboliſh the Command, ſo the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Praemial Sanction does not continue the Obligation of the Command, where an Act of expreſs Allowance has taken it away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His other Maxim, That the taking away of the Sanction does not take away the whole Obligation of the Law, wants a little explanation too; for though I readily grant, it will not in all caſes have that effect, yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in ſome it may. There are certain Laws that are as well ſatisfied with the bearing of the Penalty, as with obeying the Precept; and Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> confeſſes as much concerning thoſe Laws that are purely Penal, that is (as he ſays) that do not oblige abſolutely to the Fact, but only conditionally either to the Fact, or to the Penalty; that there are ſuch Laws I grant, only in this I differ from him:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 50.</note> Whereas he ſays, theſe purely Penal Laws bind to the Penalty, I think we are not bound to the Penalty by the Authority of the Law, but only by the honour and reſpect due to the Law-giver; that is, a man is not bound in Conſcience to ſuffer the Penalty if he can avoid it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting an affront upon the Office of the Magiſtracy; for by our Laws as well as the Law of Nature, no man is bound to accuſe himſelf of any thing that has a Penalty annexed to it, eſpecially ſince the repealing of the Oath <hi>ex Officio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are thus far agreed, that there are Laws that do not abſolutely bind to the Fact: Now the Queſtion is, Whether the Act of Uniformity and the reſt, as far as they relate to Proteſtant Diſſenters, be not ſome of thoſe Laws that he calls purely Penal?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> well obſerves, <hi>That Human Laws are not therefore purely Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal becauſe Human;</hi> and no queſtion but he is ſo far right; Human Laws may be ſo juſt and warrantable, and advantagious to the Publick Intereſt, that they may formally oblige to Obedience; how then ſhall we find out what Laws are purely penal, and what are not ſo?</p>
               <p>Truly here the Gentleman leaves us in the dark; He tells us it is by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that any Laws are purely Penal, and not from the Specifick Nature of the Laws themſelves; but theſe Logical terms of Accident and Specifick Nature are not ſo proper in matters of Law, nor are we ever the wiſer in this caſe for them; for who can tell what Accidents thoſe are that make this difference, ſince he has not been pleaſed to inform us? And though he adds, It is not from the different Authority of the Law, but from the different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Law-giver that any Laws are purely Penal, that is, do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige abſolutely to the fact, yet we are never the nearer ſatisfaction; for if the Obliging power of theſe Laws depend upon the Intention and Will of the Law-giver, one would think where that Will and Intention are different, the Authority of the Law muſt be different, for the Authority of the Law, and its Obliging power, are the ſame thing; but not to contend about the Phraſe, let us examine the Notion it ſelf, which is, That it is the different Will and Intention of the Law-giver that makes any Law purely Penal; there are two inconveniencies I think attend it.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:93151:39"/>
               <p n="1">1. The Will and Intention of the Law-giver any farther than it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by the words of the Law, is very doubtful and uncertain; and more eſpecially where the Legiſlative Power is in the hands of ſo many as it is with us; for it's poſſible the King may intend one thing, the Lords another, the Commons a third; yea, there may be an infinite variety of Intentions amongſt both Lords and Commons; and if we ſay the Intention of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority muſt carry it, yet by what Scrutiny ſhall that be found out? And if the Will and Intention of the Law-giver muſt be underſtood only by the expreſs words of the Law, I ſuppoſe it will be hard to find any Statutes, that in expreſs terms declare, they do not intend to bind abſolutely to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and yet ſuch Laws there are, by the Gentlemans own acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſay, it is the different Will and Intention of the Law-giver, that makes any Law purely Penal, will reſolve the Obliging power of Human Laws into the Will of Man, which is liable to conſiderable prejudices. And I find this ſame ingenious Gentleman in another Treatiſe,
<note place="margin">Miſcellan. conſid. of the Nature of ſin, Sect. 11, p. 370, 371.</note> has choſen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Obliging power of all Laws (Divine as well as Human) not into the bare will and pleaſure of the Law-giver, but in the fitneſs of the Laws themſelves to promote the common good; and this aptneſs, fitneſs or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote the common good, he tells us, is the Supream, Eternal and Irreverſible Law which preſcribes meaſures to all the reſt, and is the laſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of good and evil; and he thus analyſes the immorality of an Action into its laſt Principles; <q>It is to be avoided becauſe it is ſin, it is ſin becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, it is forbidden becauſe it was in it ſelf fit to be forbidden; it was fit to be forbidden becauſe naturally apt to prejudice the common Intereſt, which is above all things to be regarded and proſecuted as the beſt and greateſt End:</q> And though he acknowledges, Authority is to be obeyed, let the inſtance wherein Obedience is required, be never ſo indifferent, yet ſtill, the reaſon of this Obligation, is not derived from the Authority of the Law-giver, <hi>but from the common good,
<note place="margin">P. 372.</note> which requires that the Supream Authority be obeyed;</hi> and yet by the way, I cannot ſee how his foregoing Chain of Cauſes, will admit of any meer poſitive Laws; for, did he not ſay, a thing is therefore forbidden, becauſe it is in it ſelf fit to be forbidden, as naturally apt to prejudice the common good: Now if this be ſo, an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Action which is not naturally and in it ſelf apt to prejudice the common good, cannot be either forbidden or commanded; for according to his Scheme, the fitneſs to promote the common good is not only the Reaſon of our obeying Laws, but the Rule of God's making them alſo, being (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the Supream, Eternal and Irreverſible Law which preſcribes to all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Now, if the Will of God muſt not be made the Ultimate Reaſon of our Obligation to obey his Laws, but their fitneſs to promote the common good, certainly the Will of Man muſt not be the Reaſon of the Obligation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Laws; it would be very odd and dangerous to aſcribe more to the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93151:40"/>Will of Man, than to the Will of God; therefore we muſt enquire for ſome better Reaſon, why ſome Laws oblige abſolutely to Obedience, and other not, than meerly the different Will and Intention of the Law-giver.</p>
               <p>And I ſuppoſe the true <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of this kind of Laws, is to be found in the matter of them, and thoſe Laws are purely Penal, which require things ſo very trivial and indifferent, as naturally and in themſelves have no fitneſs at all to promote the common good, nor any tendency that way; and though I dare by no means ſay, that this tendency to common good is a Law ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, as that God himſelf muſt always obſerve it in his Commands and Prohibitions, and that the Obliging power of his Laws is to be reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; for I doubt not, God may command things that have no ſuch ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in themſelves, meerly to try whether men will obey the Authority of God for its own ſake; yet I am verily perſwaded men ſhould make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good their Rule in every Law of theirs, and that amongſt men; <hi>Salus Populi eſt ſuprema Lex,</hi> and that God has not given them Authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing,

                  </note> but what has a tendency thereunto: And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> and others were wont to put the <hi>bonum publicum</hi> into the Definition of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Laws, and to affirm that thoſe Edicts which command things no way tending to the publick good <hi>(quidvis potius quàm Leges cenſendae ſunt)</hi> may be called any thing rather than Laws. It is certain God has obliged Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours to ſteer by the Compaſs of Right Reaſon, and to make the Point of publick good in all their Political actions; if this be the Supream Law to all men, it muſt be ſo to them; they ought never to do an act Perſonal, or Political, but what has ſuch a tendency, if they do, they act againſt the Authority of God in this Supream Law, and therefore cannot in the ſame thing act with his Authority: And if in making ſuch Laws as have no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the publick good, they act without Authority, it is certain thoſe Laws cannot bind men to Obedience, though the publick good, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Perſons and Office of their Governours, may oblige them to ſubmit to the Penalty.</p>
               <p>The Authority of God is abſolute, is originally in himſelf and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore is not under the direction of the publick good of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but the Authority of Man is derivative, and dependant, given unto him not for his own ſake and pleaſure, but for the common Intereſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and is wholly directed and limited thereby; and therefore he cannot as God make Laws purely poſitive, no way tending to good, but meerly to try mens Obedience to his Authority; for he has no Authority to command ſuch things, and a compliance with ſuch Commands, may be ſubmiſſion, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proper Obedience. And it is obſervable, that there are many Statutes in <hi>England</hi> not repealed, and yet not regarded, becauſe the matter of them is found to be ſo very trivial, that no body thinks Conſcience any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them, as the Act for the tire of Wheels; that about the Age of all Calves which the Butchers kill; another requiring Butts for ſhooting in every Town; another, That no Bull ſhall be kill'd without Baiting; That none
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93151:40"/>ſhall pay above a Penny for a Quart of Ale, and ſuch like, which are buried and forgotten in their own unuſefulneſs.</p>
               <p>The matter therefore is come to this Iſſue, if thoſe things wherein we diſſent from the Epiſcopal party, be naturally and in themſelves apt to promote the common good, a meer ſuſpenſion of the Sanction will not excuſe us from obedience, becauſe the Laws requiring thoſe things, are not meer Penal Laws; But if they have no ſuch tendency at all, then, though our Liberty were no more but a ſuſpenſion of the Sanction, yet the Law being purely Penal, we are under no manner of obligation to Obedience by it.</p>
               <p>We have therefore theſe two things to ſay for our ſelves under this head.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Act for Liberty amounts to more than a bare ſuſpenſion of the Penalty, for it allows of our Congregations, it ſecures us from diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, laying a penalty upon all thoſe that ſhall preſume to do it, it exempts our Miniſters from ſerving in any Secular Offices, which is conferring a kind of reward upon them.</p>
               <p>I cannot but take notice, how weak and ineffectual theſe Gentlemen would now make this Suſpenſion of the Penal Laws to be, and how little influence they will allow it to have upon the Preceptive part; and yet when it was their Intereſt in the Late King's Reign to decry the Suſpenſion of them by the Kings Declaration onely; They pretend and plead, that if that Declaration have any Legal effect, it would diſcharge Miniſters and People from attending upon the Publick Service of God, thus Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer</hi> Pleaded in the Biſhops Trial;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 100, 103.</note> 
                  <q>When a Law is ſuſpended the obligation thereof is taken away; Now (my Lord) with ſubmiſſion, I have always taken it, that a Power to abrogate Laws is as much a part of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a Power to make Laws; A Power to lay Laws a-ſleep and to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend them, is equal to a Power of abrogating them, for they are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Being as Laws, while they are ſo laid a ſleep or ſuſpended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Though it ſhould amount to no more but a bare ſuſpenſion of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, yet it is ſufficient to excuſe us from Diſobedience, becauſe the Laws hereby ſuſpended are meer Penal Laws, that is, ſuch as require things that are no way apt to promote the common good, thoſe that ſay they are, muſt prove it, however here we remove the Cauſe out of that Court, and muſt ſtand or fall by the intrinſick worth and nature of the things commanded.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF we come off clear in theſe great points of Catholick Unity, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Superiors, we ſhall more eaſily defend our ſelves againſt the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer imputations of Indecency and Irregularity.</p>
               <p>We begin with that of Indecency, and therein ſhall enquire, firſt into the Nature and Rule of Decency, ſecondly into the Practice of the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, and how far it is agreeable to thoſe Rules.</p>
               <p>We fully aſſent and conſent, to that great Law of Decency laid down in Scripture, and believe the tranſgreſſion of that as of all other Divine Laws to be abſolutely ſinful; We do not think it an indifferent thing whether we worſhip God decently or indecently; But the queſtion is, what may be the Standard or Rule by which Decency is to be meaſured, our thoughts about it (ſuch as they are) we ſhall lay down in a few words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be ſomething Antecedent to the Command of Superiors; even the Apoſtle himſelf when he commands that all things be done decently, ſuppoſes that there was a Decent way and method of acting, which they could not be ignorant of; he does not by his command make the Decency, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it, and obliges them to the obſervation of it; We therefore conclude De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency is not a thing of meer poſitive inſtitution, nor depends upon the Will and Command of Men, but is of higher Original, even the Light of Nature, and is no other but the Natural decorum of an action: To ſay the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are therefore Decent becauſe commanded, is as much as to ſay, were there no ſuch command, there would be no Decency in them, and therefore that the omiſſion of them is guilty of no other inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency than that of diſobeying Superiours, and where Superiours are pleaſed to ſuſpend ſuch commands, the Worſhip of God may be performed as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently without them, which indeed is to ſet aſide the Argument of decency and to betake our ſelves wholly to that of Obedience which has been already diſcuſſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis therefore Nature (or Cuſtom which is a ſecond Nature) that is the rule and meaſure of Decency;
<note place="margin">Vind. of Prot. Prin. <hi>p.</hi> 100.</note> And Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> argues rationally upon this point, when his Adverſary would ſuggeſt that there is as much neceſſity of an Oecumenical determination of Decency and Order, as of a National
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93151:41"/>one, he anſwers <q>No, for Decency of Worſhip is nothing elſe but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the External Acts of Worſhip in ſuch a manner, as may expreſs our Reverence and Devotion to God, therefore ſince there are no Catholick ſigns of Decency, there can be no Catholick Uniformity in theſe matters, The Decency of Garments, Poſtures, Geſtures, differ in ſeveral Countries, and ſo do the expreſſions of Honour and Reverence, and therefore ſuch exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rites being only for external Decency, and having no ſacredneſs by inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, may vary with the different cuſtoms and uſages of Countries: But as to National Churches, ſince the uſages and cuſtoms of the ſame Nation, and Rules of Decency are the ſame, the Biſhops may agree upon an Uniformity of Rites for a National Church;</q> The ſumm is, it is not the Command of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, but the Cuſtoms of a Country that make a thing Decent, and therefore the ſame Rites may be commanded throughout a Nation, becauſe the Cuſtoms upon which Decency ſtands are the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we make Cuſtom the Rule of Decency we do not mean, This or that way of Worſhiping of God is Decent, becauſe we are accuſtomed to Worſhip him ſo, but on the contrary, We uſe to Worſhip ſo, becauſe it is Decent, that is agreeable to our cuſtom of expreſſing Honour and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in other caſes; Otherwiſe we ſhould make the ſame thing the Rule of it ſelf, and ſay, this Worſhip is Decent becauſe it is cuſtomary, and it has been our cuſtom to Worſhip God thus, becauſe it is Decent: which would be running the ring; beſides, then might all the fopperies of the Roman Church ſet up for Decency, becauſe they are now become cuſtomary; No actions or geſtures in the Worſhip of God, how long ſoever they have been uſed, can plead Decency, but thoſe which are uſed in other caſes, as well as in Divine Service, and therefore uſed in the ſervice of God, becauſe agreeable to the general cuſtoms of Decency in other matters.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nothing is required of us by the Law of Decency, but to preſerve the Worſhip of God from all Indecencies; It is impoſſible to prove that we are obliged by that Law to uſe this or that Ceremony in the Worſhip of God, if it may be managed decently without them; If the Omiſſion of ſuch Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies do not render the ſervice of God Indecent, the Law of Decency is not broken; As no man can be charged with a breach of the Law of Juſtice, but he that has done ſome unjuſt thing, or of the Laws of Charity, but he that is uncharitable, ſo none can be charged with breaking the Laws of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, but he that Behaves himſelf Indecently in Divine Worſhip; As there is no medium between Juſtice and Unjuſtice, ſo there is none betwixt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Undecency, and when of two actions one is ſaid to be more juſt, the other muſt needs have ſomething of injuſtice in it, ſo when one thing is more decent, the other muſt have ſomething of indecency, for theſe things being privately oppoſed, admit of no medium in a capable ſubject.</p>
               <p>There are ſome indeed tell us of certain tranſcendental heights of Juſtice, Charity and Devotion, which might be omitted without ſin,

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93151:42"/>14th. Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I cannot tell; it is like ſuch men will pretend to the ſame Eminencies of Decency too, but ſo long as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, we may fall ſhort of ſuch acme's without Sin we are well enough, the Nonconformiſts pretend not to ſuch high Attainments, they would be heartily glad, could they come up to the Rule in any thing, but are ſo far from pretending, that they do not deſire to exceed it, nor do they grudge theſe Gentlemen that unweildy Glory, of being wiſer and better than God has commanded.</p>
               <p>Now let us Examine the Practice of Diſſenters, in their worſhipping of God, and its agreeableneſs with the Rules of Decency; The <hi>Cheſter</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman falls upon the Vindicator for ſaying; <q>We deſire the Rules of the Goſpel may be carefully look'd into, and ſuch a Model of Government and Worſhip taken from thence, as may be likely to anſwer the great ends thereof, that nothing may be impoſed, but either what is expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or has a natural and proper tendency to promote that which is ſo, then would the Worſhip of God appear like it ſelf, Rational, Grave and Majeſtical, becoming reaſonable Creatures to offer, and a Being of perfect Simplicity, and Spirituality to accept; Nor would we as we are accuſed under pretence of Spirituality, reject the natural Decorum of an Action in Divine Worſhip, but only lay aſide theſe Formalities that are over and above natural Decency, which in Civil Converſe are counted Foppiſh, and daily grow out of repute betwixt man and man, and are no where ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper as in the Service of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now what harm is there in all this, the Gentleman it ſeems has nothing to object againſt it, but all the Queſtion is, Whether the Worſhip of God in our Conventicles be as agreeable to this Rule, as their is in the Churches; and no doubt he thinks the Caſe is half determined, by the very Names Churches and Conventicles; for is it imaginable that men ſhould worſhip God as decently in a Conventicle, as in the Church? All the Club will ſay, and ſwear too 'tis impoſsible; but what if our Aſſemblies are as much Churches as theirs, and theirs as much Conventicles as ours; 'tis true enough for any thing he has yet produced to the contrary;
<note place="margin">Of Schiſm.</note> Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> tells us, that all pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aſſemblies in times of Perſecution and Corruption are the only lawful Congregations, and the publick Aſſemblies though according to form of Law, are indeed nothing but Riots and Conventicles, if they be ſtained with Corruption and Superſtition.</p>
               <p>He charges the Diſſenters with Indecency, 1. In their Expreſsions. 2. In their Geſtures. 3. In their Habits.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Expreſsion, becauſe our Miniſters uſe not a ſtated form of Prayer, and therefore he accuſes them of <hi>Ruſhing into the preſence of God with the raſh and ſudden thoughts of one ſingle Perſon, with a Prayer newly Coined, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sterling or no, is uncertain, being never tried, for the People know it not till it be out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But muſt it needs follow, that becauſe we have not a form laid before us,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93151:42"/>that our thoughts are therefore raſh and ſudden, is he ſure that we never uſe Premeditation both as to the general Method and Matter of Prayer? And for the words if they be uſually Scripture Phraſe, I hope they will paſs for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in a more equal Ballance than his; Will this Gentleman ſay, that all conceived Prayer is raſh and irreverent? Then I am ſure he will condemn the moſt learned and pious Divines, yea and Biſhops too of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who in the Pulpit commonly uſe ſuch Prayers, and ſometimes of a conſiderable length too, which we may be ſure they would not do, if they thought it impoſſible for the People to joyn with them in it; and if the Duty of Prayer may be performed rationally and gravely without a preſcribed form, this Objection vaniſhes into putrid Air.</p>
               <p>If this Gentleman would only ſay that He and his Companions, cannot expreſs themſelves rationally and reverently in the preſence of God, without a preſcribed form of Words, we would not contradict them, they beſt know what they can do, but to ſay, that without ſuch a form, it is impoſſible to perform this Duty aright, is (as the Vindicator ſpeaks) little leſs than Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon upon the common ſence of Engliſh men; and I am ſure it is contrary to the whole ſcope of that excellent Book of Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> called the Gift of Prayer; for my part I thank God, for the acquaintance I have had, with ſome plain poor People, that in their Prayers to God would expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in much more proper and pertinent Language, than this Gentleman has yet attained to, though he be the Author of at leaſt two famous Books.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In our Geſtures; that in Prayer they are confuſed, and irreverent, I know not what he intends by theſe Words, We judge it our Duty either to kneel or ſtand, in the time of Prayer, either of which are poſtures of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to ſit or loll we utterly diſallow, unleſs in caſe of bodily weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inability, where they are excuſed, by that Rule, God will have Mercy and not Sacrifice; I wonder, how this Gentleman ſhould come to know our poſtures, better than we do our ſelves. I ſuppoſe he has ſeldom appeared in our Aſſemblies, unleſs it was in former days, when he came at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by his Setters to break them up, and then perhaps the Terror of ſuch a One might put the People into poſtures odd and confuſed enough, but if he pleaſes to come now, when his Thunder-bolts are ſpent, he may ſatisfie himſelf that our Geſtures are almoſt as grave, though not ſo genteel as his own.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems the Diſſenters ſit and loll, and are covered, at the reading of the Pſalms; as for ſitting, I know not why it ſhould be more irreverent at the reading of the Pſalms, than other parts of Scripture, or than at the ſinging of the Pſalms, and at ſuch times, I am ſure in Churches they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſit.</p>
               <p>And that we are uſually covered, either at the Reading or Preaching of the Word is not true, and yet I know of no great Crime in it,

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93151:43"/>the Act for enjoyning the Common Prayer, forbids both Affirmatively and Negatively any other Method or Form of Service Rites, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies than is there directed; ſome Churchmen are great Nonconformiſts in diſobeying that Rule, by ſeveral Additions in approach to Popery, as in their ſecond Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As alſo in being ſuperabundant to Popery, in endeavouring to make a Superſtitious Faſhion, to ſit bare during Sermon, which is but a new thing in <hi>England,</hi> and not known in any other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, for though the Papiſts are bare in their Churches out of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-time, whom we endeavour to imitate in that Circumſtance, yet they are covered during Sermon, wherein we outdo them; and he tells us, That the Miniſter of <hi>Finchly</hi> not long ſince cauſed one to be committed for being covered, whilſt he was in his Sermon, who bringing his Action againſt the Juſtice for falſe Impriſonment recovered good Damages of him; which though ſufficient to prove the Churches Uſurpation in this matter, they do notwithſtanding go on in it, as a part of that new Popery formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by <hi>Laud</hi> in his time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the Gentleman is chiefly ſcandalized at our Geſture in receiving the Sacrament,
<note place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 46.</note> wherein (he ſays) we ſit like Clowns and Bumkins; but who told him that we ſit ſo Clowniſhly? A man may ſit very decently and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely, and how does he know, but we do ſo? I hope meerly ſitting is not the thing that makes a Bumkin, for then this Gentleman is forced to be a Bumkin almoſt all the day long; nor ſitting in the Service of God, for that he does too; and why it ſhould have ſuch a peculiar Ruſtical quality at the Lords Supper, rather than in other Ordinances I cannot imagine; eſpecially when for any thing that appears, our Saviour uſed it in the very Inſtitution of the Ordinance, and the Apoſtles even when they received it from his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand, and though I am not of their minds, that think this makes ſitting neceſſary, yet I am ſure it will at leaſt defend it from the ſcandal of an irreverent Poſture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Habit of our Miniſters is not pleaſing, For (ſays he) <hi>He who adminiſters in their Divine Service, as they call it, has no other habit than what is due to, and becomes a Tradeſman or any other Laick in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here again, we have Reaſon to complain that the matter of Fact is not truly repreſented, for our Miniſters are generally diſtinguiſhed from others,

W.</hi> thinks otherwiſe, one of his own Fathers has condemned him for Superſtition.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> in his Friendly Debate ſpeaks to the ſame effect;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 115.</note> 
                  <q>Then do we make the Ceremonies parts of Divine Worſhip, when we ſuppoſe them to be ſo neceſſary, that the doing them would be a thing pleaſing to God, and the omitting of them would be a thing diſpleaſing to him, although there were no Humane Law, that required the doing of them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now we may thus argue, If it were indecent to omit theſe Ceremonies, it would be diſpleaſing to God, who has commanded that all things be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently; but we ſee the Defenders of Ceremonies, when they are put to it have no way to defend themſelves from the guilt of Superſtition, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting new parts of Divine Worſhip, but by declaring, that theſe things are in their own Nature purely trivial, and the uſing of them would not be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93151:44"/>at all pleaſing to God, nor the Omiſſion diſpleaſing, were they not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and enjoyned by humane Laws, that is to ſay, the Worſhip of God is not at all the more decent for them, nor the leſs decent without them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We come to the point of Order, and here indeed we are moſt blamed by the ſober Conformiſts, as acting irregularly, ſetting up diſtinct Aſſemblies in Pariſhes, and drawing away the People from the Pariſh Miniſter, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches out of Churches, which the Presbyterians formerly condemned in others.</p>
               <p>To this we Anſwer, That we really approve of all Prudent Rules for the more orderly and effectual Management of the Miniſterial Function, and in ordinary Caſes, we judge it convenient that the Charge of a Miniſter ſhould be confined within ſuch bounds, as our Pariſhes, but we do not think this to be a matter of that Conſequence,

               <p>The Learned Writers of their own party,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Defence of Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> p. 59.</note> tell us, that the Diviſion of Churches by Pariſhes is of a later date, and we know it is not ſo nicely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by themſelves, but that many Chappels of Eaſe have been ſet up, and filled with People of divers adjacent Pariſhes, the Miniſters ſometimes celebrating both the Sacrament, and no Exceptions taken, and why may not our Aſſemblies be look'd upon as ſuch? If it be ſaid theſe Chappels are all under the Pariſh Miniſter, yet it cannot be denyed but they may be freed from that dependance by Law, and made diſtinct Churches, and exempted from the Juriſdiction of the Parſon or Biſhop as ſeveral places already are; unleſs we will with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> curſe the Number two, becauſe it was the firſt that did depart from Unity.</p>
               <p>But we acknowledge it were more deſirable to have the Parochial way obſerved, intereſt, as well as a due regard to Order, would invite us to it, if we could comply with thoſe terms that are required of us in Order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; Our Caſe is plainly this, The Laws of the Land allow us to Aſſemble in other places, upon ſuch Qualifications as we heartily approve of, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us not into the Publick Churches, without ſuch a further compliance as we cannot in Conſcience come up unto.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, this is that part of the Controverſie, which I have the leaſt Mind to meddle with, not becauſe it is the moſt difficult, but becauſe it may ſeem to reflect upon the Wiſdom or Integrity of many Worthy Learned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, of whom I would not ſpeak or think without due reſpect; but the importunate clamours of this Gentleman, and men of his temper extort it from us, he is often challenging us at this Weapon, as in his Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 4. <q>If theſe men have any thing impoſed upon them by our Governours that is ſinful, let them ſhew it, and their Plea muſt be allowed, but they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſs, the terms of Obedience impoſed are but indifferent things, meer trifles, now for a man to diſobey his Governours and have no
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93151:44"/>other Plea but this,</q> is too mean an excuſe from the Tranſgreſſion of a known Law; This he ſeems to expreſs with a great Elevation of Mind, as if it were a killing Sentence, when indeed it is as fooliſh and inconſiderate, as his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries can deſire. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not true, that we confeſs the terms of Conformity to be things In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, when the Vindicator ſays they are ſuch by acknowledgment, he plainly ſpeaks of the Acknowledgment of the Impoſers, not of the Diſſenters, and no Body can underſtand it otherwiſe, but thoſe that have a mind to be miſtaken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Governours do not now impoſe ſuch things upon us, as terms of Obedience, and therefore all the noiſe he makes about Childrens diſobeying their Parents, becauſe they ſuſpect the Lawfulneſs of their commands, is out of doors, and yet by the way, he would be a very ſevere Father, that ſhould force his Son upon the higheſt Penalties to do a thing,
<note place="margin">Crudelis Pater magis quàm Puer improbus ille —</note> which he himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes is altogether needleſs, and good for nothing, eſpecially when the Son really ſuſpects it to be unlawful, and thinks he cannot de it without diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God; all the World would condemn the Barbarity of ſuch a Father; Bleſſed be God, the illuſtrious Parents of our Countrey, are too juſt and merciful to command ſuch things; our Nonconformity is indeed a loſs to our ſelves, but no diſobedience to our Superiours, as has been already argued at large.</p>
               <p>The Authors of the Enquiry and Vindication, waved this Point of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Conformity, out of meer Reſpect and Civility to their Brethren that are otherwiſe minded, and choſe rather to infiſt upon thoſe general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Love and Charity towards weak and ſcrupulous Conſciences, which the Scripture abounds with, being willing to admit that we are miſtaken in theſe matters, rather than to expoſe the miſtakes of others, but this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had not the Civility to make a ſuitable return, but encourages himſelf, by that Modeſty of theirs to inſult, and hector, and cry aloud, for proof of the ſinfulneſs of Conformity, declaring that they will admit of no other Plea.</p>
               <p>But what if terms of Conformity be not ſinful, it is ſufficient for us, that we are under no Obligation to comply with them; our Governours have left us at our Liberty, and though the Biſhops may ſtill command them, yet our own Paſtors are as truly Biſhops as they; The Unity of the Church does not depend upon them, but may be much better preſerved without them, and the Act of Liberty in the Preamble, declares, that it is the Senſe of the King, Lords and Commons, that not Conformity, but eaſe to ſcrupulous Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences may be an effectual means to unite Proteſtants in Intereſt and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Worſhip of God may be as decently performed without them; how are we then obliged to comply with ſuch things? Will he ſay it is our Duty to uſe all thoſe Ceremonies and Cuſtoms in the Worſhip of God that are not ſinful? What if a Papiſt ſhould ask him; Why do you not Conform to all the Ceremonies of our Church? Why do you not uſe Salt and Cream, and Spittle, in Baptiſm? Why do you not Croſs your Breaſts, and Shave your
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93151:45"/>Heads? Can you prove theſe things to be ſinful? I ſuppoſe this Gentleman would reply, we care not whether they be ſinful or no, we are not obliged to uſe them; and if the Papiſt ſhould alledge the Command of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, he would reply, No Forreign Prelate or Potentate has Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to enjoyn ſuch things upon us, and our own Governours have not done it; if the other ſhould urge, that we muſt comply for Unity ſake, he would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The Unity of the Church lies not in Uniformity of ſuch Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; if the Papiſts ſhould preſs it further, Theſe are decent Ceremonies, and ſerve to excite in men devour thoughts of God and Chriſt, and have rare myſtical Signification, ſurely He would rejoyn, The Worſhip of God is managed by us very decently without ſuch things.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſay in anſwer to his demand, if we be not obliged to Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, though it ſhould not be unlawful, our Nonconformity is very juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; therefore this Plea of the Sinfulneſs of the thing, is not now ſo neceſſary as he imagines; but leſt we ſhould ſeem to acknowledge that we had nothing to juſtifie our practice heretofore, when Conformity was required by the Law. And that we are ſtill for an unaccountable Singularity, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to differ from others meerly for diſtinction ſake, and have no regard to Parochial Order, which we have formerly ſeemed to approve of; I ſhall venture to ſay ſomething upon this point, though I am ſenſible before-hand ſome will blame me for ſaying ſo much, and others for ſaying no more.</p>
               <p>The World is not to ſeek for the Reaſons of our Nonconformity, a large Account has been given thereof in a Multitude of Treatiſes, ſome of which have received no anſwer at all, as Dr. <hi>Rule</hi>'s <hi>Rational Defence,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s <hi>Engliſh Nonconformity Stated and Argued;</hi> wherein the Caſe is ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly and yet ſo cloſely debated, in the ſeveral particulars both of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial and Lay-Conformity, that it ſeems wholly ſuperfluous to add any thing, till we ſee what anſwer will be made unto it; I have ſeen indeed a little impertinent Scribble of two or three Sheets of Paper, wherein the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor pretends not to engage in the Controverſie, but only tells us with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence enough, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Book is an unneceſſary, unſeaſonable and unaccountable Undertaking, and has been already anſwered, which is a very quick and cheap way of confuting Diſſenters, and the common reply of every baffled Party, to all that is writ againſt them, and is only taken up as a little ſhiſt to ſerve an eaſie and credulous ſort of Men amongſt themſelves, but can never be deſigned to give Satisfaction to others; and if ſuch Trifles muſt paſs for an Anſwer to a Book ſo Large, Diſtinct and Argumentative, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s is, truly it is to no purpoſe either to write or read Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
               <p>There are three Steps a man muſt take before he can arrive at the heighth of Engliſh Conformity: 1. He muſt ſubmit to the Uſe and Practice of the Impoſitions. 2. He muſt declare his Approbation and good liking of them. 3. He muſt Swear never to endeavour any Alteration, ſome of us ſtumble at the Firſt, many ſtick at the Second, but the Laſt is moſt inacceſſible.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:93151:45"/>
               <p n="1">1. Many of us can by no means be ſatisfied with the conſtant Uſe and Practice of theſe controverted Matters, and that for theſe Reaſons amongſt others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We obſerve, That the great Corruption of Churches has in all Ages riſen from this Source, introducing unneceſſary Ceremonies in the worſhip of God, teaching for Doctrines the Traditions of Men; this had reduced the Jewiſh Church to that Leprous condition wherein it lay in our Saviour's time: And the grand Apoſtacy of <hi>Rome</hi> begun by advancing the Power of Eccleſiaſticks beyond its meaſure, and exerting it in the Invention and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of ſuch Myſtical Rites and Ceremonies, and by adding ſtill thereunto, it grew up to ſuch a Myſtery of Iniquity, and Monſter of Uſurpation and Tyranny, as it appears at this day in the World; and we know not of any Specifical Difference betwixt the Ceremonies in <hi>England</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and we could never prevail with our Antagoniſts to give us a Rule to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them by.</p>
               <p>It is uſually ſaid ours are but few, but theirs are many, and therefore bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom; but this does not ſatisfie; for many or few alters not the kind, and if it be lawful to uſe Three, why not Six, Twenty or a Hundred? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if ours be therefore better becauſe they are fewer, I hope they will give us leave to infer, the fewer Ceremonies and the better, and therefore beſt of all where there are none; if the Matter muſt be reſolved into their Poſitive decency, we have already ſhewed by their own Confeſſion there is no ſuch decency in them, but the worſhip of God may be managed as well without them: But if the Matter be fixed upon the Churches Authority, then let the Church command never ſo many we muſt comply, and ſo are as much enſlaved to the humours of the Eccleſiaſticks as the Papiſts themſelves; and the caſe ſtanding thus, we think none can juſtly blame us if we are afraid of contributing to the return of Superſtition and Arbitrary Church Power, by entertaining and embracing thoſe things, that have given it riſe and ſtrength in other Parts and Ages of the World. Our Objection againſt them is not that weak and ſilly thing ſome repreſent it, as if we reject them meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Papiſts uſe them; but we do it becauſe the Impoſition and uſe of them has given Life and Growth to the Papacy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Eſpecially ſince they are altogether uſeleſs, and have no tendency to promote that which is good, this much ſtrengthens the prejudice, they have done a great deal of harm, and they can do no good by the Confeſſion of the Impoſers, and we cannot imagine why they ſhould be retained, ſince they are neither good in themſelves, nor have a natural fitneſs to promote the Common Good; were there any uſefulneſs in them, we would not reject them, meerly becauſe they have been abuſed, but ſince by their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment the Worſhip of God is not at all the better performed for them, we cannot but judge it irrational to retain them; a Wiſe Man will do nothing deliberately in his common Converſation but what he can give ſome account <hi>cui bono,</hi> to what end he does it; And really it is ſomewhat a hard
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93151:46"/>caſe that we are in if we uſe theſe Ceremonies, and know before hand, our Duties are never the better for them, Conſcience and Reaſon tell us we are guilty of trifling in a Matter of the greateſt Solemnity, if we uſe them with an opinion that the Worſhip of God is better performed with them, than otherwiſe, their own Biſhops and Doctors tell us we are guilty of Superſtition and Will-worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We obſerve that the Dealers in Ceremonies are apt to grow upon us, and if we yield to a few, they ſtill urge us with more; and indeed the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple upon which they are defended, leaves room to bring in as many as they pleaſe, provided they be not expreſly prohibited in the Word of God, which in things of this Nature is not to be expected; for it had been an endleſs task, and would have ſwell'd our Bibles, to a Prodigious Bulk, to have precluded them all by Name, which may be as various and indefinite as the fancies of Men; Thus our Canons enjoyn ſeveral things which are not required by Law, as bowing at the Altar at the Name of Jeſus, reading ſome part of the Service at the Communion Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Practice of ſome Zealous Men outgoes the very Canons themſelves. We are very loth to launch out into ſo vaſt an Ocean, and commit our ſelves to be toſt up and down by the Caprices and Humours of Men, which are as uncertain as the Winds and Waves, and we know not upon what dangerous Rocks, or remote Shores, they may at length drive us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe things which we ſcruple, are diſapproved by the beſt Reformed Churches; we know it to be ſo from their own words; when the Miniſters of the Helvetian and French Churches were deſired to give their Opinion about theſe things, they did generally expreſs their diſlike of them; See a Book Intituled, <hi>The Judgment of the Reformed Churches,</hi> Printed at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> Octob. 24. 1547. Subſcribed by <hi>Beza,</hi> and many famous Divines of thoſe Churches.</p>
               <p>And we cannot forget the Exhortation of the poor Remains of the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> Churches, directed to the Reformed, eſpecially to that of <hi>England,</hi> by the Learned and Pious <hi>Comenius,</hi> writ in Latine, and Dedicated to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. at his return into <hi>England,</hi> I will tranſcribe a few Lines becauſe the Book is not in every Bodies hand.</p>

                  <q>As for the Pomp of Church Ceremonies, God indeed in the old way of Worſhip ordained ſuch a thing, therein by
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93151:46"/>Shaddows to ſet forth the Spiritual Myſteries of Salvation, which Chriſt at his coming was to diſcloſe; but ſeeing that ſince the coming of Chriſt, they have been demoliſhed and levelled, by ſo many Apoſtolical Strains, as Claps of Thunder and Flaſhes of Lightning directed againſt them, why ſhould we bring them up again ſtill to make uſe of them? Under the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy perhaps where the Light of the Goſpel is obſcured, in their Barbarous Generations, they might ſeem to be of ſome uſe, at leaſt with ſome colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pretence; but in a Reformed Church, I beſeech you, what uſe can be made of them? Thoſe that have been hitherto retained in <hi>England</hi> under the Reformed Biſhops, have not the very Pentificians themſelves laught them to Scorn and Deriſion? It is plain to be ſeen in <hi>Weſton</hi>'s <hi>Theatre of Life Civil and Sacred,</hi> Printed at <hi>Antwerp</hi> 1626. <hi>P.</hi> 564, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where having ſaid that the Religion of the Proteſtants is without all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, becauſe they have no Sacrifice, Prieſthood nor Sacred Ceremonies, he adds, Some Proteſtants indeed, that they may not appear abſolutely Impious and Irreligious, uſe our Miſſal and Breviary, ſelecting what they pleaſe thereof for the Rubrick of their Liturgy, and to make the Form of their Worſhip appear the more goodly, they have their Canonical Perſons forſooth, after the Modes and Cuſtoms of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their Caps, and Hoods and Holy-Days, and ſuch-like Stuff, which they ſay they found in the Synagogue of Antichriſt; by which very thing it is apparent that the Religion of theſe Proteſtants ſtands guilty of Stealth and Robbery, by which it firſt came into the World, or if they will not be taken for Thieves, let them go for our Apes: Theſe with their whole Service are derided and ſcorned not only by ours, but alſo by their own; the Engliſh ſeem to have driven the Pope out of <hi>England</hi> in ſuch haſte that they have forced him to leave his Cloaths behind him, which they as Fools in a Play, put on with a kind of Pompous Ceremony of Triumph, and ſo lead the Quire, a goodly Reformation it is that they dare not carry it through, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It will therefore be a glorious thing for the Reformed Churches to come back to the Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, leaving off the Baubles of earthly Riches, Honours and Pomp, and to look after and buſie themſelves about things of a higher Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> This and a great deal more to the ſame purpoſe is there to be ſeen, by which it appears, not only that thoſe renowned Martyrs and Confeſſors called the <hi>Taborites,</hi> diſliked our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but that the Papiſts themſelves, for whoſe ſake they are retained, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and ridicule us for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are thoſe amongſt us that could bear with the uſe of theſe things, but cannot declare their Approbation of them, and their Aſſent and Conſent to all of them; this would be to eſpouſe and commend thoſe things which at beſt they look upon but as <hi>Tolerabiles Ineptiae,</hi> and this Approbation muſt extend to all things required; and they cannot ſo far diſſemble with God and the World.</p>
               <p>There are many things in the Book of Homilies which they like very well,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93151:47"/>but they cannot ſay ſo of all; there are ſome very odd Paſſages, which they cannot Aſſent to;

               </p>
               <p>There are many good Petitions in the Liturgy, and good Directions in the Rubrick, which we could (ſome of us) freely uſe; but we cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with our ſelves to Aſſent to that Notorious Miſtake in the Rule for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Eaſter,</hi> nor can well digeſt that Complemental Prayer, <hi>Thoſe things which for our Unworthineſs we dare not, and for our blindneſs we cannot Ask, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to give us for the worthineſs of thy Son.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3dly, We muſt not only uſe and approve theſe things, but muſt Swear, That we will not endeavour any Alteration in the Government of the Church; this the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act requires of us, and that in terms as Univerſal as can be, and leaves us no liberty to explain our ſelves, or to ſay that we will not endeavour by any unlawful means to do it: And we remember very well how the Marqueſs of <hi>Argyle</hi> was dealt with, for putting ſuch a ſence upon the like words. It is not long ſince a Great Prelate of our Church openly declared, That the Spiritual Courts are the great Grievance of the Nation; and it is very hard we muſt be obliged to Swear, that we will not at any time endeavour the redreſs of ſuch a Common Nuſance, that we muſt not Study, Write, or Petition for it; this was a clenching blow indeed to faſten and entail all the faults of the Conſtitution upon our Selves and our Heirs for ever. This is a brief Account of thoſe things that have made us Nonconformiſts, and now keep our Miniſters out of the Pariſh Churches; thoſe that would ſee them more largely and ſtrongly and particularly argued, are remitted to the Books before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſee what the Gentleman has ſaid to Vindicate theſe Impoſitions, and then I'll bid him farewell till we meet again.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He endeavours to juſtifie them, by the like Practice amongſt the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, mentioning Three ſignificant Ceremonies impoſed by them at the taking of the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> The Perſon muſt be uncovered, muſt ſtand up, and the right hand muſt be lifted up bare; and theſe, he ſays, were terms of Communion amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Now really for my part I am much confirmed in my diſlike of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Impoſitions, becauſe I find the Defenders of them are forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of juſtifying, to recriminate, and all they have to ſay, is the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93151:48"/>were as bad as they, when they had the Power in their hands; and if there be any Strength in ſuch a Reply, it concludes againſt themſelves for doing that which they condemn in others, and all that it proves is, that all Parties have been at one time or other tranſported into unreaſonable Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties againſt each other, and ſurely then 'tis time for all to amend, unleſs they reſolve to perpetuate theſe Quarrels, and to act them alternately in an End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs round.</p>
               <p>There are not many Diſſenters now alive that remember any thing of thoſe days, and fewer that were any way concerned in them; And many of thoſe that were at that time moſt zealous in urging the Covenant, and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Abjuration, were the firſt that turn'd with the Times, and became as Troubleſome and Vexations on the other Side; and yet the inſtance which this Gentleman brings ought to be a little examined, for 'tis neither Pertinent nor True as to Matter of Fact.</p>
               <p>It is not pertinent, becauſe not appertaining to the ordinary Worſhip of God; that which he calls the Rebellious Covenant, was a Solemn Oath whereby Men bound themſelves to endeavour in their Places a Reformation both in Church and State, according to the Word of God, and particularly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the King's Perſon; purſuant to which Clauſe, Thouſands of Scotch and and Engliſh hazarded all that was dear to them on the behalf of the Royal Family,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Royal Declar. at</hi> Dumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Aug.</hi> 16. 1650.</note> it was deliberately and voluntarily taken by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, who profeſſed himſelf deeply humbled for his Father's Oppoſition to it, and that upon full perſwaſion of the Juſtice and Equity of all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles thereof, he had Sworn and Subſcribed it, and was reſolved to adhere thereunto to the utmoſt of his Power, and to proſecute the Ends of it all the days of his life: And it is certain, the Reſtoration of that Prince is very much owing to the Sence which a great many had of the binding Power of that Covenant; as Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> ſhews in his Defence of it againſt Dr. <hi>Gauden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this being a Solemn Oath, muſt needs as all other Oaths, require ſome ſignal Expreſſion of Conſent, according to the Cuſtom of all Civilized Nations; in ſome this Conſent is ſignified <hi>Viva voce;</hi> in ſome by kiſſing the Book, in <hi>Scotland</hi> by lifting up the Hand, and as we had the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from thence, ſo their Signification of Conſent was uſed alſo, being more ſuitable for the expreſſing the Joynt Conſent of a Multitude, than any other; but this is nothing to Myſtical Ceremonies in the ſtated Worſhip of God; if no more had been required of us in the late Troubleſome Times than to kiſs the Book when we were called to take an Oath, there would not have been many Diſſenters, excepting thoſe that ſcruple Swearing upon any Account.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is not true, that this Covenant with the manner of taking of it, was ever impoſed as a term of Communion. The Houſe of Commons indeed, and the Aſſembly of Divines took it, and moſt of thoſe that held any Office of Profit or Truſt, but it was never impoſed upon any on Pain of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93151:48"/>Excommunication or Suſpenſion from the Lord's Supper;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ruſhworth's Coll.</hi> Part. 3. p. 475.</note> it was to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to all in general, and an Exhortation drawn up for the ſatisfying of thoſe that might ſcruple the taking of it, but it was forced upon none by any Penalties Corporal or Spiritual; if the Ceremonies and Subſcriptions had been no otherwiſe impoſed, it had been happy for us. The Presbyterians neither impoſed nor uſed any Myſtical Ceremonies of their own deviſing in the Worſhip of God, they never tied Men up to the Words of their Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, nor required any to Subſcribe to it, or declare their Aſſent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to all things therein contained; they never obliged Perſons to Swear againſt endeavouring an Alteration, but bound themſelves to promote a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of whatever ſhould be found to be contrary to the Word of God; and therefore they gave no Preſidents for what has been done againſt them in the late Reigns.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Gentleman tells us, the Apoſtles made meer Ceremonies Terms of Communion in their days; which is not true, and yet if it were, would not juſtifie others in doing ſo, who have not the Commiſſion and Power which the Apoſtles had.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman inſtances in having all things Common in their Love-Feaſts, and in the holy Kiſs, and affirms, that theſe were meer Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies impoſed by the Apoſtles as terms of Communion; but he's miſerably out all along.</p>
               <p>As to the Cuſtom of having all things common, nothing more evident than that it was a thing purely voluntary, and impoſed upon none. St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells <hi>Ananias,</hi> Whilſt it remained it was his own,
<note place="margin">Acts 5.4.</note> and after it was Sold it was in his Power, he might have done with it what he pleaſed; but the Sin was Lying againſt the Holy Ghoſt, in pretending they had dedicated the whole to God when part was kept back; ſurely this was more than the omiſſion of a meer Ceremony.</p>
               <p>And he is not more happy in the ſecond inſtance of the Love-Feaſts, for as they were no Parts of Religious Worſhip, but either going before or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following the Euchariſt, ſo it no where appears that they were ever inſtituted by the Apoſtles at all, much leſs impoſed as terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and though ſome Learned Men think the Apoſtles recommended them to the Churches, yet I ſee nothing in Scripture to ground ſuch an Opinion upon, but rather on the contrary; for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20, 21. the Apoſtle does not only reprove them for their Diſorders in thoſe Feaſts, but ſeems to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve of the very thing it ſelf, and adviſes them rather to Eat their Meat at their own Houſes, than to make thoſe Solemn Aſſemblies, Places and Times of ſuch Feaſting: And the Learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> ſeems to have a great deal of reaſon for what he ſays upon this place, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Jewiſh part of the Church retained ſomething of the Old Leaven, and could not forbear Judaizing in this Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, and therefore it muſt be attended with a Feaſt, as the Paſſover was: And he obſerves, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle does not only find fault with their abuſe herein, but with theſe very Feaſts
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93151:49"/>themſelves, in that they diſhonoured the Church by bringing their Meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, which they ſhould rather have eaten at their own Homes.</p>
               <p>And as ridiculous it is to ſay that the holy Kiſs was impoſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles as a term of Communion, it was indeed the manner of Friendly Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a meer Civil Rite uſed amongſt Jews and Gentiles as well as Chriſtians, and the Apoſtles Command relates only to the ſincere, chaſte and honeſt uſe of it, as became Perſons devoted to God, and that they ſhould not ſuffer that Token of Reſpect to degenerate into an Hypocritical or Laſcivious Complement.</p>
               <p>It is ſo far from being plain that theſe things were impoſed as terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by the Apoſtles, That it is certain from their own words, They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to lay no burthen upon Chriſtians but neceſſary things, that is, things that had ſome good tendency; for that is the ſofteſt ſence that the word Neceſſary will bear, and our Engliſh Ceremonies, by the Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all can never come under that Denomination.</p>
               <p>And indeed if the Apoſtles had made theſe things terms of Communion in the Catholick Church, they muſt have remained ſo to this day, unleſs by ſome latter Apoſtolical Edict repealed, for who will dare to alter the Apoſtolical terms of Communion; and it may be, this Gentleman's deſign is to revive theſe old Ceremonies of Feaſting, and Kiſſing and having all things common, not only for the ſake of their Apoſtolical Inſtitution; but, as being all of them Ceremonies of very comfortable importance to a Man of his Temper and Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>But after all, if it were plain that the Apoſtles made meer Ceremonies terms of Communion, it will ſcarcely follow, that our Biſhops may do ſo too, no more than that they may write Canonical Epiſtles, and make Laws to bind the whole World as the inſpired Apoſtles did; To make terms of Communion is a very great Power, eſpecially if out of Communion there be no Salvation, for then to make terms of Communion, is to make the terms of Salvation, and to put ſuch a Power into the hands of weak and fallible Men, is a thing of ſuch diſmal Conſequences to the Souls of Men, that we may be ſure our Bleſſed Redeemer would never do it: He has in his own Perſon, and by his Apoſtles whom he inſpired, fixed that Law by which he will juſtifie and condemn Men, and has not left it in the Power of any Mortal to add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and to pretend to ſuch Power, is not only to impoſe upon Men, but upon God too; as if he muſt ask them leave, whether he ſhall have a Church upon Earth, or no.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS Upon a PAMPHLET ENTITULED, A REVIEW OF <hi>Mr.</hi> M. H<hi>'s. new Notion of Schiſm, and the Vindication of it.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Title of this Paper imports, that there has been ſome kind of Anſwer already made to the Enquiry and Vindication, but ſuch as the Zealous Club judge Lame and Impotent, and therefore have thought fit to order a Review; great things ſurely may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from this, which comes to ſupply the defects of the former.</p>
            <p>Methinks the Author of the Reply, is more concerned in this thing called a Review, than either the Enquiror or Vindicator,
<note place="margin">Reply <hi>p.</hi> 2.</note> for 'tis a ſcurvey intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that his own Confederates do not believe him, when he boaſts that he has run down his Adverſary, and proved, and ſhewed, and demonſtrated every thing, for if they had entertain'd as good an opinion of the ſucceſs of his laſt expedition, as he himſelf has, it had been the moſt ſuperfluous thing in the World to have come with a Review, before the other had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an Anſwer, theſe things would almoſt perſuade a Man to think,
<note place="margin">P. 35.</note> that <hi>T. W</hi>'s Reputation is not ſo great amongſt the party as he pretends.</p>
            <p>But whether this latter comes out on purpoſe to Affront the Citizen, or whether it be with his conſent upon conviction of the miſerable weakneſſes of his Reply, I neither know nor care; my buſineſs is to enquire whether the valiant Second has done any greater ſeats, than he that firſt engaged in the quarrel.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:93151:50"/>
            <p>This Gentleman muſt not expect an Anſwer, to his famous and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Oxford</hi> Jeſts; I conſider the humour of his party, and how dull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid every thing is to them how rational ſoever, that has not a great mixture of Farce and Comedy in it, for my part I ſhall take no more notice of them, than I would do of thoſe little ludicrous wanton Creatures, that can make themſelves excellent ſport, with their own Tails and Shadows.</p>
            <p>As to the Enquiry, there are two very material things he encounters in it, the Deſign and the Management. He will not allow the Deſign of it to be Honeſt and Peaceable, to allay heats, and create a better underſtanding amongſt us, as the Vindicator pretends, that deſign it ſeems is too high, and the Vindicator aſcribes too much to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in ſaying, he endeavoured to create a better underſtanding betwixt parties that had been ſo long and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly contending, this is to place him in the Chair, and make him an Oracle, and I do not know what ſo uneaſie a thing it is to Proud Men to hear any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy commended but themſelves; it ſeems the Reviewer had no deſign to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate differences, or to contribute any thing to a better underſtanding betwixt Church-men and Diſſenters, he, modeſt man, will not pretend to take ſo high an aim, for my part, I believe this was not his deſign, but then I am ſure it muſt be ſomething worſe, that is, to enflame the differences, and perplex the controverſie, and no doubt he has managed ſuch a deſign as well as he could.</p>
            <p>He tells us Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s deſign was no greater than to ſatisfie the ſcruples of ſome perſons, and to make two Female Proſelites, which is a great piece of news to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> for he declares he knows nothing of it, and deſires the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to name the Perſons that were to be drawn in, and to tell us at what Goſſipping he pickt up this Story, or elſe we muſt lay the Brat at his own Door; I leave it to the Reader to judge what expectations Mr. <hi>H.</hi> could have from this Book, when he found ſo notorious a Fiction in the very firſt Page.</p>
            <p>And truly he goes on as he begun, telling us that Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Notion of Schiſm will turn all Church Diſcipline out of Doors,
<note place="margin">Review. <hi>p.</hi> 3.</note> for if breach of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion be no Schiſm as theſe Gentlemen alledge, a Man may appeal from the Stool of Repentance to the Quakers Meeting Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good reaſon that ſome Men have ſo great a ſpight at the Stool of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, there are a ſort of Men that hate it, as a Thief hates the Gallows, the Citizen could not forbear it in his Book; But to let that paſs, I wonder where this Gentleman finds any ſuch a Sentence in either of the books he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to review, as that breach of Communion is no Schiſm, let him produce it, or confeſs himſelf worſe than a trifler; Both thoſe Books acknowledge Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Communion to be Schiſm, if it be uncharitable, and to be ſinful if it be without good reaſon, and how this can be prejudicial to Church Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline I know not, unleſs by Church Diſcipline be meant that uncharitable, unchriſtian, and tyrannical thing, that has been ſometimes acted under that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93151:50"/>Title, and if that ſhould be turned out of Doors by this account of Schiſm, all wiſe men will love it better upon that ſcore.</p>
            <p>He proceeds, We have reaſon to queſtion the peaceableneſs of his deſign,
<note place="margin">Review. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> for the Notion it ſelf being contrived to encourage and juſtifie Separation, I am afraid the laſt reſult and conſequence of it will not be peace; this has as little honeſty in it as the former, there is not the leaſt tendency in Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Notion to encourage or juſtifie any ſinful Separation, nay it lays the ſtricteſt tye upon perſons to ſee to it not only that the cauſe of their Separation be juſt, but the manner of it peaceable and charitable too; if the Cauſe be not juſt it is ſinful, and if it be not managed peaceably and charitably it is Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical: Nay it obliges perſons in the ſame Communion to avoid uncharitable contentions about the leſſer matters of Religion, upon pain of being convicted of Schiſm by the Word of God, and how the effects of ſuch an opinion ſhould be any other than peace, I cannot unleſs it be by an Antiperiſtaſis, and the powerful oppoſition of contrary principles that ſome Mon have ſuckt in; I confeſs when theſe Gentlemen are ſo often telling us of the loſs of peace, if Diſſenters will not all come to Church, it appears to me like a menacing the Government, as if they were reſolved to throw all into confuſion again, unleſs they may be reſtored to the liberty of trampling us under foot, and if our preſent Indulgence be attended with ſuch dangerous ſymptoms, I believe they do wholly ariſe from the diſcontents of ſome four and haughty Spirits, that cannot be ſatisfied with all their Grandeur, whilſt <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſits in the Gate and will not bow.</p>
            <p>But (ſays he) ſuppoſe a Man ſhould introduce the ſame doctrine into the State, and tell people that it is lawful to act in ſeparate Bodies, that they need not own the Preſent Government; but where has Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaid any thing like this in the whole Enquiry? Does he any where ſay Men need not to own the Government that God has eſtabliſhed in his Church, but may act by a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their own? I wiſh this Gentleman can clear himſelf as well of ſuch a Doctrine, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> may; If he means that it is as unlawful to have ſeveral diſtinct Biſhops and Churches in the ſame Dioceſs, as ſeveral Kings in the ſame Kingdom, he deſerves the rebukes of the Government much more than Mr. <hi>H.</hi> or the Vindicator either; It is plainly the drift of theſe Men, to make themſelves as abſolute Governours over the Laity, as Princes over their Subjects, and if they can perſuade Men, that it is as great a Crime to leave the Miniſtration of their Pariſh Prieſt, what ever he be, and go to hear ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is as truly a Miniſter of the Goſpel, as to rebel againſt their Prince, and ſet up another in his room, they have taken a great ſtep towards it.</p>
            <p>His harangue about the Preſent Government, about the Title of K. <hi>James,</hi> the Nature and Rights of Soveraignty, he may if he pleaſes reſerve for the Illumination of his Brethren, that are for diſtinguiſhing between Kings <hi>de facto</hi> and <hi>de jure,</hi> without which Vehicle they could not ſo eaſily have ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Oath of Allegiance, or for his dear Friends in the Jacobite Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93151:51"/>whom (it may be) he would willingly excuſe from Schiſm, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Separation, becauſe they ſtill adhere to Epiſcopacy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, thoſe fundamental Principles of Unity; that which follows in the ſame Paragraph, is equally falſe and impertinent, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> never ſets people at liberty to break into parties or to make any ſuch diviſions as he ſpeaks of, but endeavours to prevent all ſuch things, by fixing a brand upon that divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in affection, which commonly gives the riſe to all other ſinful diviſions amongſt men.</p>
            <p>As to the differences betwixt the Presbyterian and the Independant Party in former times, with which he upbraids us, I ſhall only ſay, if the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Churches were framed according to the Word of God, and laid no other Burden upon their Members than neceſſary things, according to the Apoſtles Canon, which all Churches are for ever bound to obſerve, that Separation was Sinful, and if it proceeded from uncharitableneſs it was Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, according to Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. Notion; And if this Conceſſion will do him any ſervice, let him take it and make his beſt advantage of it: And if it be ſinful to break off from Particular Church Communion without juſt cauſe, it is much more ſo for men to deny and renounce Communion with all Chriſtians and Churches that will not comply with needleſs inventions of their own.</p>
            <p>We are now come to Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Deſcription of Schiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is an Uncharitable Diſtance, Diviſion or Alienation of affection, amongſt thoſe who are called Chriſtians, and agree in the Fundamentals of Religion, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by their different apprehenſions about little things.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman firſt charges this Deſcription of Schiſm with Novelty and Wildneſs, and then proceeds to draw out the conſequences; But as to Novelty and Wildneſs, if it be the Scripture notion of Schiſm, it will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently clear it ſelf of ſuch imputations; The queſtion Mr. <hi>H.</hi> propoſed, was not what the Fathers called Schiſm, but what the Spirit of God calls ſo in his Word, it was this which he undertook to anſwer, and if he has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf well in that, he is not concerned what this or that Father calls Schiſm: and this deſcription is founded on the caſe of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They were called Chriſtians,</hi> and it was fit to put that into the definition for we are not enquiring into the Schiſms of Jews, Turks, or Pagans.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They agreed in the Fundamentals of Religion,</hi> that is, in all that was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, otherwiſe the Apoſtle would ſcarcely have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them the Title of Brethren and Saints, acknowledging the Grace of God in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That there were contentions amongſt them to the prejudice of Chriſtian Love and Charity,</hi> will not be denied, ſince the Apoſtle plainly reprimands them for it; And that theſe contentions were <hi>occaſioned by different apprehenſions, is equally certain, otherwiſe there would have been no room nor pretence for ſuch conteſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that all this was about little things,</hi> that is, comparatively little, on which Salvation does not neceſſarily depend, is ſufficiently plain, from the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93151:51"/>good account that is given of theſe perſons as to the main, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe unhappy differences; Theſe contentions thus circumſtantiated the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls Schiſms, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> though a man might without danger or offence conclude, That an Uncharitable diſtance or alienation of affections amongſt thoſe that are called Chriſtians, occaſioned by their different apprehenſions about little things is Schiſm, according to the Scripture notion and account of it.</p>
            <p>But nothing will pleaſe thoſe that have a mind to be quarrelſome, this muſt be bantered, for a wild, novel, and bungling deſcription, the lateſt that ever was Coined; And yet if this Gentleman had peruſed the Homilies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> before he ſubſcribed to them, as in all Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience he ought to have done, he would have found ſuch an Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Mr. <hi>H's</hi> deſcription of Schiſm, and the ſenſe of his own Church as would have obliged him, for his own ſake to have treated it with better language.</p>
            <p>Let him conſult the Homily againſt contention, <hi>F.</hi> 9. and there he will find that the Church of <hi>England</hi> places the Unity of the Church in Concord and Charity, and the Rents or Schiſms of the Church in diſcord, contention bitter Emulation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh how the Church is divided! Oh how it is cut and mangl'd! Oh how that Coat of Chriſt which was without Seam is all rent and torn! Oh body Myſtical of Chriſt, where is that holy Unity, out of which, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is, he is not in Chriſt! If one Member be pulled from another, where is the Body? We cannot be joined to Chriſt our Head, except we be glued with Concord and Charity one to another, for he that is not of this Unity is not of the Church of Chriſt, which is a Congregation or Unity together, not a Diviſion, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that as long as Emulation, or Envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Contention and Factions, or Sects be amongſt us, we be carnal and walk according to the Fleſhly Man; And St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, if ye have bitter emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or envying, or contention in your hearts, glory not of it, for where conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, there is unſtedfaſtneſs, and all evil deeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing is more evident than that the thing declaimed againſt in this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is Schiſm, what elſe ſignifie the words cut and mangled, divided, rent and torn? And as plain it is, that this rending and tearing, and cutting and mangling the Body of Chriſt, is done by contention, by the violation of concord and charity, without which we cannot be joined to the Head, nor one to another, it is true it mentions Factions and Sects,
<note place="margin">He ſpeaks of contentious Sects.</note> but there may be Factions amongſt thoſe of the ſame external Communion, and there are many Sects too in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the external Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is the ſame, and ſo there were formerly amongſt the Jews, and at this day in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſome are Arminians, others Calviniſts in points of Doctrine; But both the Title of the Homily, and the expreſs words and general ſcope of it, make the Rents and Schiſm in the Coat of Chriſt to conſiſt principally in the want of Concord and Charity, in Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, envying, and heart contentions; Which I hope will juſtifie Mr <hi>H.</hi> from the cenſure of having advanced a wild, and novel doctrine.</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:93151:52"/>
            <p>Now let us examine the Conſequences, which this Gentleman has drawn out of this Definition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of all, From hence it will follow, that he that was never truly admitted into the Chriſtian Church may be guilty of Schiſm, if he be called a Chriſtian.</hi> But before we can tell whether there be any abſurdity in this, we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to explain himſelf and tell us, what he means by a true admiſſion into the Chriſtian Church; If by admiſſion he means Baptiſm, and by true admiſſion, Baptiſm after the form and mode preſcribed by his Church, I doubt not there are many may be juſtly called Chriſtians that were never ſo admitted, and if he will take upon him to aſſert that none can be guilty of Schiſm, but who have been admitted according to their Canons, he will fairly acquit a great number of Diſſenters from that crime, who though they have been Baptized, yet not altogether according to their Rubrick; As for Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Words, they are plain enough, Schiſm in the Scriptural Sence, is only the fault of profeſſed Chriſtians, and all profeſſed Chriſtians are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Members of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Hereticks in fundamentals are no Schiſmaticks, for Mr.</hi> H. <hi>ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that where there is a Schiſm, both parties muſt agree in the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Religion.</hi> Yes, he does ſuppoſe ſo, and very juſtly, for thoſe that deny fundamental Truths are without the Chriſtian Faith, without the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church; and where there is no ſuch Union, there can be no Schiſm which always ſuppoſes a previous Union; As Treaſon always ſuppoſes that a Man be a Subject of the King, and Member of the Common wealth.</p>
            <p>If a Man never received the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, he never was a Member of Chriſt's Body, and therefore never a capable ſubject of that Chriſtian Love, and Brotherly kindneſs, the violation whereof is the thing in Scripture called Schiſm, if he has formerly profeſſed the Faith, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards renounced it, he has by ſo doing, diſſolved that principal Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Union with the Chriſtian Church upon which Brotherly Love is built, and therefore after ſuch Apoſtacy cannot be formally guilty of the breach of Chriſtian Charity, becauſe he is indeed no Chriſtian and ſo no capable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſuch Charity, and can no more properly be called a Schiſmatick, than a Stone or Tree can be called blind, or any other thing in which there is no capacity of Sight.</p>
            <p>And if the Gentleman do not like this Notion, he may if he pleaſes write a Book to convince the Grand Signior, and the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and Cham of <hi>Tartary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> that they are all Schiſmaticks, as were their Fathers <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> the Egyptian Sorcerers before them.</p>
            <p>But he adds <hi>This is as much as to ſay the greater the fault, the leſſer the crime.</hi> By no means, for what if Hereticks be not Shiſmaticks, are they therefore innocent Creatures? What if Traytors, Murderers, Adulterers be not Schiſmaticks, are they therefore Saints? Hereſie in Fundamentals is a greater crime than bare Schiſm, and the leſs is merged in the greater; And it ſeems very ſtrange that the ſame Gentleman; who but a line or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93151:52"/>thinks it abſurd to call thoſe Schiſmaticks, who were never truely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church, ſhould think it alſo abſurd, not to call thoſe Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks that either never embraced the Chriſtian Faith, or have ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third inference is, <hi>According to this Definition, Alienation of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is Schiſm, but Diviſion or Alienation of Communion is not:</hi> Here he ought to have told us, what he means by Diviſion or Alienation of Communion; Communion with the ſame God, and the ſame Mediator, and in the ſame Eſſentials of Faith and Worſhip is neceſſary to the Being of Chriſtianity, and an Alienation here is ſomething worſe than Schiſm, if he mean perſonal Communion in the Worſhip of God in the ſame place, and after the ſame Mode, 'tis impoſſible this ſhould be undivided; if by Alienation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion be means withdrawing from that particular Church of which we have been members, and joyning with another, 'tis no more but what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to all, upon the removal of their Habitations, and may be lawful on many other accounts, but if it be done without ſome good reaſon it is ſinful, if it be done out of Uncharitableneſs towards the Church we leave, it is Schiſm; now if he would be as plain with us as we deſire to be with him, there might be hopes of bringing the matter to ſome iſſue.</p>
            <p>But the laſt Inference is moſt remarkable both for Phraſe and Sence, and I would deſire the Author to review it. <q>No one can charge another with Schiſm, except he be able to look into his Heart, it is impoſſible to know according to this Deſcription, that People are Schiſmaticks, if they profeſs themſelves to be in Charity, except we ſhould enquire into the Secrets of their Hearts, and on the contrary People may be the greateſt Schiſmaticks under the outward Profeſſion of Charity, and yet no Body can accuſe them with it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But pray, why is this laſt Sentence ſaid to be <hi>on the contrary</hi> to the former, <hi>it's impoſſible to know that People are Schiſmaticks, if they profeſs themſelves to be in Charity, and on the contrary People may be the greateſt Schiſmaticks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the outward Profeſſion of Charity, and no Body can accuſe them.</hi> Here's a marvellous contrariety betwixt theſe two Sentences, <hi>montibus illis erant, &amp; crant in montibus illis,</hi> I ſuppoſe by on the contrary he meant on the Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, at leaſt he muſt give us leave to take it ſo.</p>
            <p>But is there no way then to know mens Uncharitableneſs, but by looking into the Secrets of their Hearts? Did he never hear of a rule, by their Fruits ye ſhall know them? How often does this Gentleman accuſe the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer and Vindicator with Malice and Uncharitableneſs? If he had no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for this by overt acts, we know what to call him, but if he had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground for it, then his Inference is ſpoiled and proves like the former.</p>
            <p>Only thus far we will allow him to argue, if Schiſm conſiſt in ſuch Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs, and Alienation of Affection, men ought to be very cautious how they call one another Schiſmaticks, leſt they ſhould be guilty of that Sin themſelves, whilſt they are charging it upon others; and I ſuppoſe this is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93151:53"/>not the leaſt of our Authors Prejudices againſt Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Notion; that it will not ſuffer men to be continually bawling, Schiſmaticks, Schiſmaticks, againſt all that are not of their own Perſwaſion; but I am ſure all but Schiſmaticks will like it the better, upon this account, that it would lay a reſtraint upon men, that they ſhould not without very good grounds, fix ſuch a brand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Neighbours, nor as heretofore hunt them out of Churches, Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and out of the World too as far as in them lay, by the noiſie cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours they have raiſed about this Word.</p>
            <p>Our Surveyor proceeds to blame this Notion for want of clearneſs, and puts wonderful hard Queſtions. 1ſt. <hi>Whether this uncharitable diſtance muſt be really amongſt thoſe that are Chriſtians;</hi> But this is the ſame thing over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and has received its Anſwer, they muſt really be ſuch as profeſs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but who are real Chriſtians God knows, and if theſe men will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear calling Diſſenters Schiſmaticks till that matter be fully cleared, the World would be much quieter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Qu. <hi>What does he mean by Fundamentals of Religion?</hi> But what ſtrange perverſeneſs is this in thoſe who ſo often tell us, we have all the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Religion in the Apoſtles Creed? He asks, Whether Fundamentals of Salvation, or Fundamentals of Truth, and I anſwer they are Fundamental Truths neceſſary to Salvation; he urges further, are they ſo to every man in his Private Capacity, or are they the Fundamentals of Church Communion? Theſe are mighty pretty Diſtinctions, pray why ſhould thoſe things be Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Church Communion, which are not neceſſary to the Salvation of particular Perſons?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Qu. <hi>What does he mean by little things? Whether all Manner of little things, or Eccleſiaſtical little things?</hi> Had this Gentleman look't into the caſe of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he might have anſwered himſelf, they are ſuch things as relate to the Affairs of the Church, which are comparatively ſmall, that is, ſmall in Compariſon of the great things wherein they agreed, and of the great heats theſe things cauſed.</p>
            <p>From theſe little quibbles, which do no Body harm but himſelf, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to his former Practice of falſifying Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Words, for (ſays he) Mr. <hi>H.</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Review.</hi> p. 7.</note> there is but one Scripture in the Old Teſtament relating to this Affair, <hi>viz. Num.</hi> 11.21. But what if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſay no ſuch thing? Why then, all his fine Obſervations upon it fall to the ground, and he muſt give us leave to obſerve that he is a very unfair and unjuſt Writer; all that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſays, is, The Old Teſtament will not help us ſo much in this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry as the new, only mentioning that one Text, and that not as giving us a proper Notion of Schiſm, but only helping to rectifie ſome miſtakes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</p>
            <p>Now I'll be ſo Civil to this Gentleman, as to help him to take this matter aright, He ought to conſider, what that Enquiry was which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſays the Old Teſtament will not be ſo helpful in as the New, it was not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the Church has been troubled with Schiſms? it was not his deſign to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93151:53"/>write a Hiſtory of all the Schiſms that ever were in the Church, either ſince Chriſt, or before; then indeed, if he had ſaid the Old Teſtament will not be ſo helpful to us, the Gentleman might have inferred that the Jewiſh Church was not infeſted with this Sin; but the Enquiry was, What is that thing which the Scripture calls Schiſm? And thoſe Texts were to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally diſcuſſed, that have the Word Schiſm found in them; and by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the circumſtances of thoſe Caſes and Actions, which are charged with Schiſm, he comes to determine the formal Nature of that Sin; and there may be a hundred Texts relating to the thing, which would not be in the leaſt helpful to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in this Enquiry, till he had firſt cleared that to be really the thing called Schiſm, which muſt be proved by comparing it, with that which in expreſs terms is ſo called: This was Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Method, and I think a very proper and rational One; and therefore the Caſes which this Gentleman mentions of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> of <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> of <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> were very juſtly omitted by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> for how bad ſoever thoſe Practices were, they cannot be proved Schiſmatical till it be made to appear that they are of the ſame kind and quality with thoſe which Scripture calls Schiſms.</p>
            <p>He is pleaſed to divert himſelf, with the inſtance of <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad;</hi> Propheſying in the Camp, which he ſays is forreign to the buſineſs. 1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were to bear the weight of the Government with</hi> Moſes <hi>under God.</hi> But was it not in Subordination to <hi>Moſes?</hi> Was not he the chief Governour ſtill? And are not the Presbyters allowed ſome ſhare of Government with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops? and does that make them incapable of being Schiſmaticks? 2. <hi>Their Propheſying was for a ſign.</hi> Well, be it ſo, and would have leſs anſwered that end, if theſe two, had been with the reſt of them in the Tabernacle. 3. <hi>They were acted by a conſtraining impulſe, which ſurely is not the Caſe of our Nonconformiſts;</hi> No ſurely, nor of the Conformiſts neither, though they openly declare at their Ordination, that they are moved by the Holy Ghoſt to take upon them the Office of the Miniſtry; But what if <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> propheſied by impulſe, did not Mr. <hi>H.</hi> obviate that Objection by putting us in Mind, that the Spirit of the Prophets is Subject to the Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22. And though this Gentleman ſays, that Scripture is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently alledged, yet wiſer men, as <hi>Grotius</hi> and others, give that ſence of it, which makes it as pertinent as any thing can be, <hi>viz.</hi> The Spirits of the Prophets are ſo ſubject to the Prophets themſelves, that they are not acted with that urging Violence as will not allow a Compliance with the Rules of Order; that is, they might if they had pleaſed notwithſtanding the Spirits reſting upon them, have come into the Tabernacle as the reſt did.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he adds, <hi>all this was ſecular, and diſtinct from that which did more peculiarly belong to the Eccleſiaſtical Body.</hi> But propheſying was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred thing, and the Tabernacle a ſacred place, and that People a ſacred People; and if the buſineſs of <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> was not too much ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to come within the Verge of Schiſm, I wonder this ſhould be thought ſo
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93151:54"/>forreign; but indeed after all, he wholly miſtakes Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s deſign in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which was not to ſhew what was Schiſm, but what was not ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Separation or Irregularity in ſacred Actions is not Schiſm; this is that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, which by this Text he endeavoured to rectifie, and whether it be not appoſite enough for that purpoſe is left to the Judgment of the Conſiderate Reader.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman is ſo very deſirous to caſt upon Mr. <hi>H.</hi> the reproach of ignorance, that rather than fail, he will betray his own, and ſomething elſe which is worſe; Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaid, the Jews were obliged to worſhip at one place, and immediately explains it concerning Sacrificing, which being the moſt famous and noted part of their worſhip, may well be called ſo by way of eminency,
<note place="margin">Joh. 4.20.</note> as it is ſeveral times uſed in the diſcourſe betwixt our Saviour and the Samaritane Woman, and he adds, This Obligation is vacated by that Goſpel that wills us to pray every where; from hence our Surveyor would infer, That Mr. <hi>H.</hi> thought the Jews were to pray no where but at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when his own eyes would have told him, that in the ſame Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph Mr. <hi>H.</hi> acknowledges the Jews had their Synagogues, which are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the patterns of our Chriſtian Aſſemblies than the Temple; The only doubt is, whether that Rule, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. ſince it only mentions Prayer, was pertinently alledged as vacating that Obligation which confined the Jews to one Altar; It is certain, it has been ſo underſtood by as Learned men as ever writ upon Scripture; I hope <hi>Grotius</hi> will be <hi>inſtar omnium</hi> with this Gentleman, his words upon the place are, <hi>Preces Deo hodie non minus grata ſunt in quavis Eccleſia quàm in Templo Hieroſol.</hi> and he bids us compare this with, <hi>John</hi> 4.21. And <hi>Danaeus,</hi> and <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> are with him in it, all theſe and many more were ſo ignorant as to think that only one part of worſhip is here mentioned, yet it is a rule which relates to the whole, and takes away all pretences of the Holineſs of Places.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman ſeems to deny, that the Jews were obliged, only to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer at one Altar, and tells us of an Altar at Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> of <hi>Samuels</hi> Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at <hi>Mizpah, Zuph,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Eliſha</hi> at Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> and ſays, the Jews had their Synagogues, and inferiour Altars, which were ſtill in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Supream One; and yet afterwards, he tells us out of <hi>Sigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> that there were no Synagogues till the time of the Captivity,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Review,</hi> p. 13.</note> that they who wanted the Temple to pray and teach in might have ſome place like the Temple in which they might aſſemble to perform that ſort of Duty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes that the Jews were confined to that one Altar at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 11.</note> till that Obligation was taken away by our Saviour; now what can a man do, but wait with patience till this Cameleon has aſſumed ſome certain colour, and when he has told us which of thoſe inconſiſtent opinions he will abide by, he may expect a reply.</p>
            <p>It is certain there was an expreſs Law confining the Jewiſh Sacrifices to the Sanctuary which God ſhould chuſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.13, 14. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf that thou offer not thy burnt Offering in every place thou ſeeſt, but in the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93151:54"/>place which the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe in one of thy Tribes there ſhall thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy Burnt-offerings.</hi> Yea all that was Sacred to God, as their Tithes and Free-Will-Offerings, muſt not ordinarily be eaten in any other place, but that which God ſhould chuſe, and though God gave them leave in Caſe of great diſtance from the Sanctuary, to eat thoſe things in their own Gates, yet all Devoted things that were to be Sacrificed (though the diſtance was never ſo great) muſt be brought to the appointed place.</p>
            <p>What then ſhall we ſay to the Caſes mentioned, where Sacrifices were offered at other Altars? The Anſwer is plain, 1. All thoſe Anomalous Offerings excepting the laſt, were made before the choſen place was fixed, and Temple built, and it ſhould ſeem by the beginning of the 12. <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Deut.</hi> That this Law was not deſigned to oblige ſo ſtrictly, till the place was fixed, and prepared for that purpoſe; But, 2. Theſe were all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Caſes, and are not to be urged in Bar of a ſtanding Rule; we are not certain that thoſe Sacrifices were offered by the Prieſts the Sons of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and yet the Law appropriated that work to them. God may diſpenſe with his own Law, but it is a Law ſtill, and binds men, though not God, and is to be ſtrictly obſerved in all Caſes, ſaving thoſe wherein God himſelf by his Prerogative ſets it aſide.</p>
            <p>That there were any conſtant Inferiour Altars, upon which the Jews were allowed to Sacrifice, is a Notion more Novel and Wild than any thing in the Enquiry; the meer Suſpicion of ſuch a deſign in the two Tribes and a half on the other ſide <hi>Jordan,</hi> filled the People with amazement; and they appeal to God, that they had not built that Altar,
<note place="margin">Joſh. 22.22, 23.</note> to offer thereon Burnt-Offering or Meat-Offering or Peace-Offerings, and till they had made this Proteſtation, the reſt of the Tribes could not be ſatisfied; and that theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Altars were in Communion with the Supream, has as much of Sence in it as the other has of Truth; I deſpair of ever knowing what the meaning of this Word Communion is; if it may be predicated of things inanimate we ſhall never comprehend its boundleſs ſignificancy.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman we ſee is ſomething confounded in his account of the matter of Fact, let us enquire whether he be any thing more clear in his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Reaſonings from it.</p>
            <p>He is taught by Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> to ſay, <hi>That the only way of Uniting the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gullah to God was by the Sacraments;</hi> But this is notoriouſly falſe, for the Sacraments were only the Symbols of that Union,

            <p>
               <hi>That none could be in Union with God, unleſs United to the High-Prieſt,</hi> is falſe too, for the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were Gods People, before they had any High-Prieſt, or Common-Altar amongſt them; the Sacraments were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſacted by the High-Prieſts, Parents Circumciſed their Children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for a long time at leaſt, and the Paſſover might be celebrated without
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93151:55"/>a Prieſt; and all true Believers are United to God, whether they have a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or Baptiſm amongſt them or no; and the Sacrament ſuppoſes mens Union to God, but does not effect it.</p>
            <p>His Obſervations, from <hi>John</hi> 4.21. muſt be examined before we paſs them. 1. <hi>There is ſomething under the Goſpel, that does correſpond to that ſolemn Worſhip at</hi> Jeruſalem: How do you mean correſpond Sir? Their's was Worſhipping the true God according to his Word, and ours is, or ſhould be ſo; if that be correſponding we grant it, but what it is to the purpoſe I cannot Divine; he adds. <hi>The Worſhip at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and the Spiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip were the Type and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> one of another,</hi> I am loth to quarrel with him about Words, but I think it is a very improper Expreſſion; that their Prieſthood and Sacrifices and Altar were Types of Chriſt, I find the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> largely illuſtrating, but that they were Types of Goſpel-Worſhip, is neither agreeable to the Language of Scripture, nor the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches. He farther ſays, <hi>As all the Jews did Communicate at one Altar, in like manner muſt all Chriſtians partake in the ſame Spiritual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> If by Sacrifices, he means that which Chriſt offered up to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we aſſent to it as a great Truth, or if he means the ſame Sacraments and Prayers, we grant theſe muſt be ſpecifically the ſame amongſt all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are informed, That <hi>the deſign of the Jewiſh Anniverſaries was to keep them in the ſame Communion, and the ſpiritual Worſhip is for the ſame End.</hi> If by the ſame Communion, he means the ſame Truth and Divine Worſhip, it is granted, or if he means their Union to one High-Prieſt, it is true ſo far as the High Prieſt was a Type of Chriſt, the only remaining High Prieſt of the Church; the ſame may be ſaid of his three other Obſervations, which are all ſafe, whilſt by the High Prieſt and Altar we underſtand Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But if he means (as he muſt if he will ſerve himſelf of them) that this High Prieſt and Altar typifie the Government of the Church by Biſhops, it is a very fooliſh and dangerous Notion; and if it proves any thing, it will prove, that there ought to be one Prime Biſhop, the Principle of Unity with whom all Inferiour Prieſts and Churches muſt be in Communion, as he ſpeaks, otherwiſe the Type and Antitype do not correſpond in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Point, which is a Center of Unity; if he ſays, every Biſhop is ſuch a Center, then the Donatiſts formerly and the Papiſts now are excuſed from Schiſm, for they have their Biſhops as well as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but I have largely proved from the acknowledgment of the moſt Learned Doctors of our own Nation, that Epiſcopacy is not Eſſential to the Unity of the Church, and I would ſend this Gentleman to them, who will teach him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Divinity, than the Mythology of Mr. <hi>Dodwel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a groſs miſtake, to ſay, <hi>That Salvation belonged only to thoſe that worſhipped at</hi> Jeruſalem, there were Proſelytes, who only ſubmitted to the Seven Precepts of <hi>Noah,</hi> and were not circumciſed, nor admitted to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Jewiſh Church,

            <p>The Myſtical reaſonings of this Gentleman from the One High Prieſt and Altar amongſt the Jews, are pure impertinencies as to the Queſtion in Hand; For the Jews were obliged to have onely One High Prieſt, and One Altar, and no more, or if they had (according to his fiction) it muſt be in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Supream One, but under the Goſpel it is quite otherwiſe, for it is in the power of Chriſtian Kingdoms, to multiply particular Churches, and diſtribute a greater Dioceſs or Pariſh into as many leſſer as they ſee good, each having their proper Biſhop, without any dependence one upon another, in point of Government, the Biſhop of <hi>Eugubium</hi> is as abſolute in his Church as the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> The Dioceſs of <hi>Cheſter</hi> might, if the King and Parliament pleaſed, be divided into twenty or a hundred Biſhopricks, without any Juriſdiction of one over the reſt, but ſuch a thing could not be done amongſt the Jews, without confounding and deſtroying their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>He blames. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> for laying ſo much ſtreſs upon the word Schiſm,

               </gap>, and what is it? Why <hi>they ſignifie a Separation of the parts, a rending or cleaving of one thing into two;</hi> no great Criticiſm! All the World knows where there is a Separation there muſt be parts Separated, but ſays he, <hi>in the Eccleſiaſtical ſence, it muſt ſignifie a dividing of Chriſts Body, which is moſt viſibly done by Separation and Breach of Communion;</hi> No doubt Schiſm ſignifies diviſion, and a breach of the Unity of the Church; But that Unity does not conſiſt in the Unity of one Governing Head under Chriſt, nor in the Unity of one Perſonal Communion, which is impoſſible, but in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith and Love; If by Separation of Communion he means multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular Churches, this is very lawful in many caſes, an overgrown Church may be divided into ten or twenty, and if it be done upon good reaſon, and with Chriſtian Love and Charity, there is nothing at all either Sinful or Schiſmatical in it; if there be any Schiſm in forming new particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93151:56"/>Churches which are ſound in the Faith, it muſt be in doing it contentiouſly and out of oppoſition to one another, which reſolves it into Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Notion of Uncharitableneſs.</p>

               </gap> is uſed figuratively, for a diviſion, and that twofold. 1. A Diviſion in Apprehenſion, for which he cites <hi>John</hi> 7.43. To this the Gentleman Replies, <hi>There was not only a diverſity of Opinion, but dividing into Parties;</hi> be it ſo, ſtill this was occaſioned by their different apprehenſions to which the Word plainly refers, ſome ſaid, This is the Chriſt, others ſaid, Shall Chriſt come out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſo there was a diviſion among the People about him, the connexion leaves no room to doubt, but that this diviſion relates principally to their apprehenſions; He ſays they were divided into Parties, ſo all men are in their differences of apprehenſion, ſome think ſo, others thus, but I hope he will not call that a ſeparation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, for then it will be hard to know where to find one Communion; We know the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are of ſeveral parties amongſt themſelves, (in this ſence of the word) about another great Perſon in the World; but (he adds) <hi>They cenſured and reviled one another,</hi> they did ſo, and this was the effect of that diviſion in their thoughts of Chriſt, like to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at this day, that ſhew very little either of Charity or Common Civility, towards thoſe whoſe apprehenſions are different from their own.</p>
            <p>As to the other Text, <hi>John</hi> 9.16. the very reading of the words will ſatisfie any Man what is meant by that diviſion, <hi>Some of the Phariſees ſaid, This man is not of God, becauſe he keepeth not the Sabbath day; others ſaid, How can a Man that is a Sinner do ſuch Miracles? And there was a Diviſion among them.</hi> That great quarrels did enſue Mr. <hi>H.</hi> never denied; the ſame may be ſaid concerning the other texts.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſays, This diverſity of opinion, judgment or apprehenſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be lookt upon as in it ſelf Criminal; The Surveyor moſt diſingenuouſly perverts theſe words, as if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> meant, <hi>It was no matter what opinion Men bad of Chriſt or his Apoſtles, no matter whether they took him for the Meſſiah or a Mad-man;</hi> Whereas in the very next words he ſays, where the matter is weighty and reacheth the fundamentals there an Error is Criminal; This was plain enough to convince our Author, or any Man in the World, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> was far from intending to Libel Chriſt, or to make an Apology for the Jews and Sadduces in their reviling of him; If this Gentleman had not told us, I could never have gueſſed how it could enter into his head to fix ſuch an odious ſence upon Mr. <hi>H's</hi> words, but it ſeems, that which led him to it was, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaid, <hi>This diverſity of apprehenſion,</hi> and why did he prefix the relative this, if not referring to the Antecedent Texts? I'll tell him, and it is a ſhame he ſhould need to be told, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> but a few lines before diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed of diviſion in apprehenſion, and diviſion in affection; and ſhewed that ſometimes <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, is uſed for diviſion in apprehenſion, and then adds this diverſity of opinion, judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, this firſt ſpecies or kind of diviſion, according to the diſtinction newly laid down; There you
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93151:56"/>have the antecedent to which the relative <hi>this</hi> refers, <hi>This diviſion, in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion is not always criminal, but the other diviſion,</hi> viz. <hi>in affection, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo;</hi> That this is the true Thred and Sence of his Diſcourſe, I appeal to any Man of Common Sence and Honeſty; It is not therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that knows not what he ſays, but 'tis the Surveyor that cares not what he ſays, ſo he may but render Mr. <hi>H.</hi> contemptible to the unthinking De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchees, the noble Patrons of his preſent adventures.</p>
            <p>The Enquiror juſtly declaims againſt that miſchievous practice of making our own opinions (like <hi>Procruſtes</hi>'s Bed,) the Standard by which to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure all others; To which the Gentleman replies, <hi>But if Authority think fit to call Mr.</hi> H. <hi>to the Standard, he is undoubtedly a Subject, and I know not why he ſhould not go as well as I.</hi> This is really a very fair confeſſion, that though he will not yield to a private perſon, in differences about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet he can be of any length, of any opinion which Authority ſhall ſet up for a Standard and call him to, A Man of a malleable, ductile, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Conſcience, that can ſtretch or contract himſelf to the Standard that Authority ſets up in matters of Religion, for he is a Subject, and muſt go to it; herein the Diſſenters differ from him, and cannot lay aſide their preſent apprehenſions in matters of Religion, either upon the call of private perſons or of Authority it ſelf, until the louder voice of Reaſon oblige them to it; And yet through the Mercy of God, Authority has taken down the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard now, not delighting either to cramp, or rack the Conſciences of Men in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>It ſeems the Enquiror and Vindicator have frighten'd this Gentleman into his Devotions, and ſet him a Praying (I ſuppoſe without the Book, for <hi>vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio dat intellectum</hi>) that he may never ſtand in need of their Charity, and I believe they have as much Reaſon to pray that they may never ſtand in need of this Mans Juſtice, for when the Vindicator was making his Apology to any that might think he had treated <hi>T.W.</hi> ſomewhat more roughly than ſuch a Man could well bear, this Gentleman tells us ſeveral times, the Vindicator boaſted of his rude and malicious uſage of the Citizen, let this Man learn to be Juſt before he pretend to be Charitable; As for the Vindicators uſage of <hi>T.W.</hi> let it be referred to all the Sober Church-men in <hi>Cheſter,</hi> where the Man is known, as well as the manner of his Writing, I am ſure ſome of his own Communion openly ſaid, he was treated in that anſwer, with but too much reſpect.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould this Author be ſo terrified with the Thoughts of ever ſtanding in need of the Diſſenters Charity; Is he afraid of the <hi>Lex talionis?</hi> There can be no danger of that, unleſs Authority ſhould ever be on their ſide, and ſet up its Standard for them, and if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſhould do ſo, this Gentleman has declared he is a Subject, and muſt go to it, for how ill ſo ever he may like the Principles of Nonconformity, while they are but the Sentiments of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons, yet if Authority ſhould ſet them up for a Standard, they are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93151:57"/>become quite another thing, he can go to it, as well as we, and be on the right ſide ſtill; If this be not fairly collected out of his own words, I know no tolerable meaning they are capable of.</p>
            <p>In the 19th Page he delivers himſelf of a Notion which I believe is really his own, <hi>i. e. That it is as poſſible for all men to agree about the leſſer matters of Religion as about its great and fundamental Articles;</hi> An aſſertion contrary to all reaſon, and the experience of Mankind; All Proteſtants acknowledge, that the Eſſentials of our Religion, are clearly revealed in Scripture, and in theſe they generally agree, but no one ever pretended the ſame of all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials, which are uſually proved or diſproved by inferences from Scripture, and ſometimes remote ones too, wherein it is common for Diſputants to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree, and eaſie to be miſtaken; whereas the Fundamentals being more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and poſitively aſſerted in the Word of God, admit of clearer demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed thoſe that think it their duty in all the leſſer matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to follow their Leaders, and that make their Commands in theſe things the Standard of Sin and Duty, have found out an eaſie Rule of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and this ſeems to be his opinion, for he ſays, if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> were better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Church Hiſtory he would find, that whole Churches and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had their peculiar Cuſtoms and Ceremonies, and yet their Members agreed well enough in their opinions about them; And I will venture to add if this Gentleman be as well acquainted with Church Hiſtory as he pretends, he knows in his Conſcience, that he impoſes upon his Reader, and would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude a great fallacy upon the World.</p>
            <p>The firſt Attempt for the introducing ſuch Cuſtoms and Ceremonies into the Worſhip of God, occaſioned a great deal of Contention and Diſcord in the Apoſtles times; and the Impoſers were ſeverely check'd by them for their Arrogance,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1.</note> and all Chriſtians commanded to ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt had made them free, and not ſuffer themſelves to be entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the yoak of Bondage, and ſo great a Diſturbance was raiſed by urge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Ceremonies,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 12.</note> that the Apoſtle wiſhes they were cut off that troubled the Church with them.</p>
            <p>And after the Apoſtles were dead, when Ceremonies began to encreaſe, (though they were not for ſome time enjoyned, but the People took them up partly of their own accord, partly upon the example of thoſe they had a great Veneration for) yet they occaſioned great Animoſities and Diſcord in the Churches, of which <hi>Socrates</hi> gives us many inſtances, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 21, 22. <hi>Sozom.</hi> l. 7.19.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Victor</hi> would needs impoſe his Obſervation of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> ſuch Feuds and Heats were raiſed thereby, as made them the ſcorn of the Pagans, and were greatly lamented by all ſober Biſhops and Chriſtians, and both <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> greatly blame him [<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93151:57"/>as Ceremonies and Impoſitions encreaſed, Contentions grew up with them, till at laſt a great part of the Chriſtian World was laid in a dead ſleep, with that Poiſon poured into the Church, and for a long time became like <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> a ſtrong Aſs, ſubmitting to every Burthen; then indeed there was almoſt a Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Agreement about Ceremonies, and a general Proſtitution of Conſcience to the dictates of the pretended Catholick Church, but that was the darkeſt and worſt ſtate, wherein Chriſtianity ever was in the World.</p>
            <p>I come now to examine this Gentleman's Account of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schiſm, and indeed <hi>[hic pes figendus]</hi> this is the Core of the Controverſie and the hinge upon which it turns, if he be right in this he has broken Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and put him upon a new Enquiry.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſuppoſes that theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> who are reproved for their Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Contentions, were agreed in the fundamental Articles of Faith, and great Truths of the Goſpel, but engaged in fooliſh and uncharitable Conteſts about the Apoſtles, ſome commending <hi>Paul,</hi> and preferring him before the reſt; others crying up <hi>Cephas,</hi> and a third ſort <hi>Apollos;</hi> thus having the Faith of Chriſt with reſpect of Perſons.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman has learned from Dr. <hi>Hammend</hi> to ſay, <hi>[That the Perſons reproved for theſe Contentions, were the Gnoſtick Hereticks,
<note place="margin">Review <hi>p.</hi> 20, 21.</note> that denied the Reſurrection of the Dead, and lived in Inceſt, and diſſwaded the People from Marriage, and ſacrificed to Idols that they might eſcape Perſecution, ſome of them pretend they had their heretical Doctrines from St.</hi> Paul,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 22.</note> 
               <hi>others fathered theirs upon</hi> Apollos, <hi>others upon</hi> Cephas, <hi>and another ſort pretended they had ſeen Chriſt himſelf, and received thoſe Doctrines from his Mouth; And (he affirms) they were Heretical Gnoſticks only, and not the Orthodox,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 24.</note> who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the Apoſtle for ſaying,</hi> I am of Paul, and I of Apollos; <hi>and concludes, that the Schiſm of the</hi> Corinthians <hi>lay in oppoſing the ſound Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Doctors, and maintaining their own wild Hereſies under the Umbrage of theſe great Names.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were it not for theſe Gnoſtick Hereticks, I know not what ſome Men could do to miſunderſtand plain Scripture; if we meet with any ſmart Reproofs in the Apoſtolical Epiſtles, ſtill they muſt be levell'd at the Gnoſtick Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; if any were guilty of Fornication, it was the Gnoſticks, if any of Temporizing, or of Schiſm, they were Gnoſticks; as if all beſides them had been Pure and Innocent. This is too great partiality, and ſavours much of the Phariſaical Humour of ſome Modern Men that are for caſting the Odium of every ill thing upon thoſe they are pleaſed to call Schiſmaticks; that under this Blind, all the Sons of the Church may come off clear, and be thought in every thing blameleſs and inoffenſive.</p>
            <p>Now although I make no queſtion but there were ſuch Hereticks in thoſe days, and that they were as bad as he deſcribes them, that ſome of them lived amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that the Apoſtle ſometimes ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, (though I ſeldom find that he ſpeaks directly to them) yet
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93151:58"/>that theſe were the perſons here reproved for Schiſm (much leſs the only perſons) I can never believe; For theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> The Character which the Apoſtle gives of theſe contentious <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in the context will by no means fit the Gnoſtick Hereticks, for we find he calls them the Church of God, Saints, and in the 9th verſe, Perſons that were called into the Fellowſhip of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, and in the very ſame verſes wherein he admoniſhes them of their Schiſmatical Contentions, he calls them Brethren, <hi>v.</hi> 10. Now I beſeech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions amongſt you, — For it hath been declared unto me, of you my Brethren, that there are contentions among you; Now this I ſay, that every one of you ſaith, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. Can any Man imagine theſe ſuch groſs and damned Hereticks, as the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> have been always deſcribed? Can we believe the ſame Apoſtle that was ſo ſharp upon thoſe that urged the Jewiſh Ceremonies, as to call them Dogs, and Evil Workers, and bid the Chriſtians beware of them, would be ſo tender and kind, ſo affectionate and endearing to the vileſt corrupters of the Chriſtian Faith, as to call them Saints and Brethren, and all the good names imaginable; I am ſure the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſeldom ſpeaks to Proteſtant Diſſenters in ſuch obliging language, and yet I hope we are not altogether ſo bad as the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the fault here reproved had been Herefie, and ſuch as this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpeaks of, there's no queſtion but the Apoſtle would plainly and expreſly have mentioned it; We never find him guilty of ſparing ſuch Sins and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as theſe; And if he had now to do with thoſe that taught damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies under that horrid aggravation of fathering them upon himſelf, and upon Chriſt too, which would have added Blaſphemy to his Hereſie, it would have been a great deal too ſoft and tender, onely to have ſaid, it has been declared unto me of you my Brethren, that there are contentions amongſt you, ſuch kind of reproof would have born no proportion to the crime, but would have been next door to a juſtifying of them, and ſo far from convincing them of the deſperate guilt they were under, that it would rather have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd them into a good opinion of themſelves and their Doctrines; It is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally obſerved that <hi>Eli</hi> greatly ſinned in reproving ſuch flagitious offences of his Sons in that mild language, Why do you ſuch things? For I hear of your evil dealings by all this People,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3.</note> nay, my Sons, for it is no good report that I hear of you, for you make the Lords People to Tranſgreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet this is much more plain and home than the Words of <hi>Paul,</hi> if he was reproving a crime of that Nature.</p>
            <p>And as we have all the reaſon in the World to think he would have been ſeverer in the caſe, ſo he would doubtleſs have ſpoken directly to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he would have expoſed and diſowned their Errors, and acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before all the World, he would have called them Hereticks, and ſet a black mark upon their Hereſies, and inſtead of ſaying, was <hi>Paul</hi> Crucified
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93151:58"/>for you, or were ye Baptized in the Name of <hi>Paul,</hi> would have challenged them, did <hi>Paul</hi> ever tell you, that there was no Reſurrection, did <hi>Paul</hi> ever give you leave to live in Inceſt, or to Sacrifice to Idols? And he would have taken that occaſion, ſince a fairer could never offer it ſelf, immediately to diſapprove and damn thoſe Errors, which they had broach'd under his Name and Authority, but there being not one word to this purpoſe, but a deep ſilence in all the Context; He muſt be able to ſwallow a Camel, that can digeſt ſuch a Notion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Had this been the caſe, the Apoſtle would certainly have made a manifeſt diſtinction betwixt the Orthodox and the Hereticks, and have plainly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the Orthodox, how to proceed againſt thoſe Blaſphemous wretches; But here is no ſuch diſtinction made, but the fault of contention charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them all, <hi>Now this I ſay, that every one of you ſaith, I am of</hi> Paul, which according to this Gentlemans Comment muſt be, Now this I ſay, that every one of you is turned Heretick, and Father your Hereſies upon me, and upon Chriſt too; I will not be ſo nice upon the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as to ſay there were none free, but doubtleſs it muſt argue a very common faultineſs, and they were ſo generally engaged in theſe fooliſh conteſts, that he could not have an Account thereof from the Church in Common, for Men do not love to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of themſelves, but the Houſe of <hi>Cloe</hi> ſent him the bad news; now can we think the Apoſtle would in ſuch general terms have aſſaulted the Hereſies of ſome particular Perſons? Would he have laid ſuch a Temptation before all ſucceeding Ages, to condemn the whole Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> for <hi>Gnoſticks;</hi> Certainly his Love to that People, and indeed Juſtice it ſelf would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him, in ſuch a caſe, to have diſtinguiſhed betwixt the Innocent and the Guilty.</p>
            <p>And it is as reaſonable to conclude, that the Apoſtle would have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Orthodox to admoniſh and reject ſuch abominable Wretches from their Communion, we ſee in the caſe of the inceſtuous perſon he did ſo, and certainly he would not have been more favourable to theſe, who according to this Gentlemans account, were no better, but rather worſe than he, and indeed as bad as can be imagined.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Advice that the Apoſtle gives to theſe contending Corinthians, ſhews that he did not ſpeak to Gnoſtick Hereticks, he counſels them to be of one mind, and to ſpeak the ſame thing, and to be perſectly joined together in one mind, and in one Judgment, and that there be no diviſions among them; Our Gentleman thinks this will prove that they were Hereticks, and I think it is demonſtration on the other ſide; For let it be obſerved the ſame perſons that he reproves for ſaying, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and I of <hi>Apollos,</hi> &amp;c. in the 12. <hi>v.</hi> and of whoſe contentions (he ſays) he had heard in the 11. <hi>v.</hi> he adviſes in the 10. <hi>v.</hi> to be of one mind, and to be perfectly joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Now if all theſe he here ſpeaks to were Hereticks, would the Apoſtle have commanded them to be all of one Mind, and to be perfectly joined together, was the Apoſtles deſign to reconcile one Heretick to another, the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93151:59"/>Heretick that was of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Heretick that was of <hi>Apollos;</hi> was he trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that the Hereticks did no better underſtand one another? And is this the meaning of that kind and obliging Admonition? Dear Hereticks, agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your ſelves, and let there be no Diviſions amongſt you? Would not this have been an encouraging and ſtrengthning them in their Confederacy againſt Chriſt, his Goſpel and Church? It would be a very ſuſpicious thing, for one that pretends to be a Loyal Subject, to go to a herd of Rebols that are quarrelling one with another, and perſwade them to keep together, and to avoid Diviſion, and to be of the ſame Mind, it would be a better Office to ſow the Seeds of Contention amongſt them, to break their Confederacy, that they might be more eaſily ſubdued.</p>
            <p>And it is not to be omitted, how cunningly this Gentleman alters the Phraſe, and <hi>being perfectly joyned together,</hi> he expounds, be well joynted and compacted in the Church; but here's no colour for ſuch a Paraphraſe, and to bid Hereticks be joyned one to another, is rather forbidding them being joyned to the Church; no doubt he would have commanded them to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their Deviliſh Errours, and return to the Truth, and would have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Orthodox to oppoſe them,
<note place="margin">For the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their ſide would have been commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> and to Contend earneſtly for the Faith delivered to them, and not to incorporate with them till they had renounced their Errors; but to bid theſe Hereticks be of one Mind, and of one Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when there lay an indiſpenſible Neceſſity on them all to change their Minds, is ſuch odd, inſipid, and infatuated Counſel, as cannot without a degree of blaſphemy be aſcribed to an inſpired Apoſtle.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Repetition of this matter in the third Chapter, affords us further Evidence, that this Gentlemans Notion is falſe, 'tis true the Apoſtle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids them there with the weakneſs of their Faith and Judgment, that they were but as Babes in Chriſt, and yet that would be a ſtrange Character of the Gnoſticks, far different from that which this Author gives us; but the Apoſtle proceeds to reprove them for Envying and Strife, and Diviſion, in ſaying, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollos, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And adds, <hi>Who is</hi> Paul, <hi>and who is</hi> Apollos, <hi>but Miniſters by whom ye believed, I have planted,</hi> Apollos <hi>hath watered, and God gave the increaſe?</hi> What ſence can any man put upon this, but that the fault here cenſured, lay in their glorying too much in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, ſome in one, ſome in another, and therefore he adds, <hi>Let no man glory in man, for all things are yours, whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollos, <hi>or</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, <hi>all are yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> Would all this have been true of the Gnoſtick Hereticks, or would this have been a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per way of dealing with them for their recovery?</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> in the paſſage this Gentleman cited would have undeceiv'd him,

               </q> Now though I can
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93151:60"/>by no means grant that upon this very Schiſm Epiſcopacy was inſtituted for the Reaſons already given, yet it is ſufficient for the preſent purpoſe, that it was upon a Schiſm of the ſame kind, and therefore the Nature of Schiſm may be underſtood hereby, it conſiſted in contending about their Miniſters that governed them in Common, and inſtead of paying a due and equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them all, ſome cried up this, another that, probably every one would magnifie him, by whom he had been Converted and Baptized, and at length it ſeems it infected the Miniſters themſelves, and they begun to challenge a ſpecial Propriety, in thoſe they had Baptized, as if by Baptiſm men had been united to them, not to Chriſt, for the Prevention whereof one was choſen from amongſt the reſt, and the Government of the whole prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally committed to him, and by this means, they endeavoured to prevent ſuch conteſts about the Preheminence for the future.</p>
            <p>Let the Gentleman apply this to the Gnoſtick Hereſie, and he will find it to be the moſt unapt and diſcordant thing in the World, were thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks under the Common Government of the Presbyters of <hi>Corinth?</hi> No, he ſays they oppoſed their Orthodox Governours, and puts the groſſeſt abuſe upon the Apoſtles, making them Haereſiarcha's; and what would it have ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to ſuch men as thoſe to have one of their deſpiſed Presbyters made a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop? How would this have put an end to the Hereſie? What tendency could it have to make them change their Minds, and renounce thoſe Opinions for which they pretended Apoſtolical Authority? Would they think that as ſoon as the Presbyter was advanced to the Quality of a Biſhop, he preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd infallible, and therefore they muſt neceſſarily ſpeak and think as he dictated to them? The World has not found Epiſcopacy to be ſuch a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Cure of Hereſie, the Arians had their Biſhops, and ſo have the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and prodigious great ones too, but they are generally the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of Hereſie of all others.</p>
            <p>I would now willingly conſider any thing that has the leaſt colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prove, that the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schiſm was the Gnoſtick Hereſie, and I have ſearched as diligently as I could thoſe three or four pages which the Gentleman has writ upon this Point, but I muſt needs ſay his whole diſcourſe upon it is the moſt confuſed Jargon, that ever I read from a man pretending ſo high as he does.</p>
            <p>The thing which he inſiſts moſt upon, to overthrow Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Notion, that the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schiſm lay in Uncharitable Contentions about their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, is that Expreſſion, <hi>And I of Chriſt,</hi> upon which he thus Harangues, <hi>Our Saviour was aſcended up into Heaven long before this, and it would have been a ſtrange wild Fancy, not to be contented with any other Miniſter excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him — beſides it would be hard to aſſign any Reaſon, why any Body ſhould prefer</hi> Paul <hi>or</hi> Apollos <hi>before Chriſt. I always thought our Saviour might have had the Pre-eminence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe Queſtions have been often put, and variouſly anſwered; ſome think the Apoſtle ſpeaks this of himſelf,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chryſoſt. in</hi> loc.</note> as if he ſhould ſay, Let others chuſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93151:60"/>who they will for Heads of their Parties, I only chuſe Chriſt for mine; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay that ſome few of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> being wiſer than the reſt, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves with the Name of Chriſtians,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Partus in</hi> loc.</note> without any other dividing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination.</p>
            <p>But that which ſeems moſt probable is, that theſe unhappy Contentions about <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> had this effect upon ſome, that they too much ſlighted them all, and pretended to be of Chriſt, in contempt of his Miniſters, and it is obſervable, that our Old Bibles Printed with large Notes in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> days, and by her Authority, give this laſt as the ſence of the place, which ſhews that it was agreeable to the Sentiments of the Biſhops in thoſe days, otherwiſe they would not have permitted thoſe Notes to have been gone along with it, and we have alſo there this account of Schiſm, that it is when men who otherwiſe agree in Doctrin, ſeparate themſelves from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; Now let this Gentleman take any of theſe Solutions, and it will be abundantly leſs abſurd than this account of the matter which he has given us.</p>
            <p>He tells us, That <hi>becauſe theſe</hi> Corinthians <hi>had not the writings of the New Teſtament, but muſt be inſtructed by their Prophets and Evangeliſts, it would be a difficult thing for them to judge betwixt the Orthodox and the Heretical;</hi> but I cannot apprehend any ſuch mighty difficulty in the Caſe; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles when ever they planted Churches, preached unto them the fundamental Articles of the Goſpel, which are few and plain, and therefore eaſily received and remembred; thoſe that believed upon their Preaching could not ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forget them, nor could they be eaſily perſwaded to think that the Apoſtles would preach one Doctrine to them, and the contrary to others, and we may be aſſured, any that ſhould come with ſuch wicked pretenſions would meet with a ſharp repulſe; and it was ſo far from being a difficult thing to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch impoſtures, that nothing but folly or faſcination could hinder them from ſo doing, and therefore when the <hi>Galatians</hi> were corrupted with the Principles of Judaical Pretenders, the Apoſtle admires at their weakneſs, <hi>Oh fooliſh</hi> Galatians, <hi>who hath bewitched you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He further informs us, <q>
                  <hi>That when there were contrary Doctrines preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the proof of each muſt depend upon the Credit and Authority of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from whom they were derived; if from Chriſt it was the greateſt, if from the Apoſtles it was next, if from one of the firſt Converts, as</hi> Apollos, <hi>it was the laſt great Authority.</hi>
               </q> I muſt confeſs, this is quite above my reach, I know not, why this Gentleman ſhould fancy ſuch degrees of Credit and Authority as theſe. The Apoſtles and Evangeliſts who were at that day infallibly inſpired, ſpoke with the higheſt Authority even that of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who ſpoke by them and in them by his Spirit, and to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Credit and Authority of what Chriſt ſpoke and of what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Preached and writ, is not only a vain but a dangerous thing, and makes ſuch a difference in the ſeveral parts of Scripture as ought not to be made, as if there was leſs Credit and Authority in ſome than others.</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:93151:61"/>
            <p>I ſuppoſe, the proof of any Doctrine would depend upon this Point rather, whether it was really the Doctrine of Chriſt, and his inſpired Apoſtles and Evangeliſts or no, if it could be evinced that any of them had delivered it, there was proof ſufficient of its Truth and Authority in the higheſt degree; The Authority of the Apoſtles was not queſtioned, nor any ſuch degrees of Credibility imagined betwixt the Doctrine of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles and inſpired Evangeliſts, as to leave room for ſuch pretended Compariſons, all the doubt was, whether ſuch a Doctrine was theirs or no, and there could not want Witneſſes in every Church to confront any one that ſhould bring ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel under any Name whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman has diſcovered a wonderful Argument for his Opinion in the form of Salutation the Apoſtle uſes in this Chapter,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.2.</note> 
               <q>
                  <hi>To all that in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place call upon the Name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, both theirs and ours, from whence (ſays he) it is plain, the Apoſtle makes two Parties amongſt them, the Orthodox and the Hereticks, theirs and ours.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This then muſt be the meaning of that Preface, The Church of God which is at <hi>Corinth,</hi> Sanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, and whoſe members are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be Saints, conſiſts of two Parties. 1. Theirs, that is to ſay, notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous damn'd Gnoſtick Hereticks, that deny the Reſurrection, and hold it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to live in Inceſt, and to Sacrifice to Idols, and that blaſphemouſly aſcribe theſe Doctrines of Devils to Chriſt and his Apoſtles; theſe are the firſt ſort of the Holy, Sanctified Members of the Church of God at <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. Ours, That is, the Orthodox that hold faſt the Truth, and the form of ſound words; Grace and Peace be to them both; certainly this would be the moſt ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Paraphraſe, that ever was invented, and yet the Gentleman ſees this plainly in the Text.</p>
            <p>But alas it affords no pretence for ſuch a Comment, for <hi>theirs and ours,</hi> plainly refer to the Lord Jeſus, who (ſays the Apoſtle) is both their Lord and ours, Theirs, that believe on him as well as Ours, that preach him to the World, or theirs, that are Gentiles, as well as Ours, that are Jews, the Common Lord of all the faithful, all the World over, thus it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, by the whole band of Interpeters, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> himſelf not Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but when a mans fancy is deeply ting'd with a Notion, every thing muſt be thought to ſupport it, or elſe, this would never have been mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch a purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I now attend his Review of the ſecond inſtance of Schiſm, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. I hear that there be Diviſions among you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> obſerves this could not be meant of breach of Communion, becauſe they all come together into one place and into the Church too; The Gentleman replies, there was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious breach of Communion even at the Communion Table, and very great and ſcandalous Miſcarriages; and who ever doubted of that? But does he call theſe things a breach of Communion? Then I am afraid it is often bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken among themſelves; when Mr. <hi>H.</hi> denies, that there was any breach of Communion, he takes it in their own Sence, there were no ſeparate Meetings,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93151:61"/>otherwiſe where-ever there is a Violation of Love and Charity amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians there is a breach of Communion, and his whole Book tends to prove it.</p>
            <p>Will this Gentleman ſay, that by theſe diviſions are meant, the rude and diſorderly behaviour of ſome amongſt them, or rather the conteſts that thoſe miſcarriages cauſed; If he ſpeaks ſence he muſt ſay the latter; Forit is not uſual, to call the miſcarriages of one ſort diviſions; Beſides theſe miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, tho' very great, were chiefly about the Love Feaſts which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Sacrament, as the Gentleman himſelf acknowledges, and therefore were not altogether ſo deſtructive of Communion, as if they had been about the Sacrament it ſelf; But if that will not do, he will try the old <hi>Salvo,</hi> and theſe diviſions muſt be into Sects and Parties that were Heretical; But how can it then be ſaid, that theſe Diviſions aroſe when they came together to theſe Feaſts, what! did ſome of them turn Hereticks preſently upon the Congreſs? And become Orthodox again when they parted, and ſo turn Hereticks anew when they came together the next time? And certainly if they were Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks the Apoſtle would have charged the reſt to have caſt them out, and not ſuffered them to Communicate with them at all, and that had been a proper and likely way to have put an End to ſuch Diſorders; But this he grounds upon the verſe following, <hi>For there muſt alſo be Hereſies among you,</hi> and blames Mr. <hi>H.</hi> for omitting it, and would fain know what we have to ſay to it; Why I'll tell him in a few words; This does not ſhew that the Diviſions he reproves were Hereſies, but gives us the reaſon why he believed the report which he heard of their Diviſions. I hear there are Diviſions or Schiſms amongſt you, and I partly believe it, for there muſt be alſo Hereſies amongſt you, I need not wonder if there be Schiſms amongſt you, for I know there will be Hereſies alſo, which are a great deal worſe; Thus it has been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by very Learned Expoſitors, and it ſeems the Natural import of the words, and their connexion with the former, and the Particle <hi>[alſo]</hi> makes it plain enough.</p>
            <p>But after all, if this Gentleman will in one place make Schiſm to be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and in another a diſorderly behaviour at the Communion Table, or at the Feaſts attending it, he will advance an Idea of it, much more Novel than Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s, and it will fairly acquit Diſſenters from being Schiſmaticks, for he can neither charge us with Hereſie, nor any ſuch diſorders at the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>The laſt place agitated is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15. That there be no Schiſm in the Body; Mr. <hi>H.</hi> acknowledges that Schiſm is that which breaks or ſlackens the Bond by which the Members are knit one to another; Here the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman preſently claps hold, and ſays, that is done notoriouſly by Separation and breach of Communion, yes, no doubt Communion is broken by breach of Communion, we won't diſpute that, but all Separation does not break Communion, if we only ſeparate in thoſe things wherein Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion does not conſiſt, the Bond is firm ſtill, therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> well added,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93151:62"/>but this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Bond not an Act of Uniformity in the ſame Ceremonies, but of true Love and Charity, the Gentleman replies, nor is the obligation of that Bond taken away by an Act of Indulgence; We grant it Sir, it is ſufficient for us that the Act of Indulgence takes away the Obligation of the Act of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, we do not deſire it ſhould take away Mens Obligations to preſerve the Unity of the Church, which we queſtion not is as Sacredly obſerved in our Aſſemblies as in yours.</p>
            <p>He falſely charges Mr. <hi>H.</hi> with ſaying that true Love and Charity is the onely Bond by which Chriſtians are knit together, he does not ſay it is the onely Bond, but certainly it is the Bond, though not the onely one, for they are United by Faith alſo, but it is onely the breach of this Bond of Love, which is properly called Schiſm; He tells us the Apoſtle inſiſts upon ſeveral other tyes and obligations whereby Chriſtians are knit together, and let us hear what they are; They are incorporated into one Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Body, but is that a tye by which they are knit together, or does it not rather ſhew us what they are when united together? Their being animated by one Spirit, and ſo having one Hope, and being within the One Covenant of Grace, are not ſo properly the Bond by which we are United, but the effects of our Union to Chriſt by Faith, and it's that is properly the Bond or Uniting Grace on our part, that joins us to the Head God in Chriſt, and from this the other Grace of Chriſtian Love reſults, by which the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are Morally united one to another; How far the Unity of the Miniſtry is abſolutely neceſſary to the Unity of Chriſts Body, has been already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed in the former part of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>He concludes his Reflections upon the Enquiry, with the ſame ingenuity which has all along appeared in him; He acknowledges that Charity is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Virtue, and every Sin is a violation of it, as Theft, Murder, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but as it would not be good Logick to make Uncharitableneſs ſerve for a definition of them all, ſo neither in the caſe of Schiſm; And we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it would not, and where does he find that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> makes uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Definition of Schiſm, he makes it but part of the Definition, the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> onely, and this Gentleman, by his own pretty Colloquy makes it to be the Generical nature of all Sin, but the Enquirer adds the <hi>Differentia,</hi> taken from the ſubject, thoſe who agree in fundamentals, and its object the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er things of Religion, and this with its <hi>Genus</hi> makes up the compleat Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which Scripture calls Schiſm.</p>
            <p>But the account which this Gentleman has given of it, is ſo uncertain and various, ſo far from a Definition, that it falls ſhort even of a bungling De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
            <p>In one place he affirms, where there is Schiſm there is a breach of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, <hi>p.</hi> 9. in another, there was a Schiſm amongſt the Corinthians, and yet they were in the ſame Communion, <hi>p.</hi> 22. In one place it is Hereſie, <hi>p.</hi> 21. In another place Fornication, <hi>p.</hi> 20. In another rude and diſorderly tricks at their Love Feaſts, <hi>p.</hi> 29. In one place it is oppoſing their Orthodox Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93151:62"/>
               <hi>p.</hi> 26. In another place, it is ſiding with them, <hi>p.</hi> 25. and yet this is the Man that cannot endure any body ſhould be thought a Conjurer in Logick and Divinity beſides himſelf.</p>
            <p>I hope the Enquiror is got ſafe out of this Gentlemans Hands. I now proceed to do the Vindicator the ſame Juſtice, in which I ſhall be brief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the merits of the Cauſe are diſcuſſed already, and his little ſcurrilous Reflections are not worth our notice.</p>
            <p>The Citizen of <hi>Cheſter</hi> preſented his Adverſary, with a Liſt of the Names of thoſe that had done Wonders in proving the Diſſenters Schiſmaticks, and the Vindicator repay'd him with another of thoſe that have defended them from that Charge: And adds whether theſe have not done as much to prove the Impoſers Schiſmaticks, as the former to prove the Diſſenters ſuch, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred not to the judgment of an intereſſed Party, but of all the unbyaſs'd part of Mankind; Our famous Surveyor asks, <hi>Where ſhall we have a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of ſuch; For thoſe that have a Liturgy and Ceremonies and Biſhops are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly for us, and thoſe that are for none of theſe, are all byaſſed againſt us.</hi> But Sir, the Queſtion to be referr'd is not whether a Liturgy and Ceremonies and Biſhops are lawful, but whether ſuch as ours be ſo, and whether it be lawful to take thoſe Oaths, and make thoſe Declarations that have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, and as there is no Church upon Earth requires the ſame things, as this of our Nation, ſo we have judges enough of this matter that are diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed, without going to Pagans or Atheiſts for them, and what their thoughts are has been already in part diſcovered.</p>
            <p>He would help <hi>T.W.</hi> to prove that a Man who is not diveſted of all Chriſtian Temper, Humility and Conſideration,
<note place="margin">Review. <hi>p.</hi> 34.</note> may yet be in a deſperate condition, becauſe it ſeems <hi>He may not have Grains enough of theſe Virtues to ſave him;</hi> What! muſt we have a ſtatical Divinity too? If a Man has Chriſtian Faith, though it be but as a Grain of Muſtard-ſeed it will be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to Salvation, and I know not why the ſame may not be ſaid of all other Graces, he that has them not in the prevailing degree, has them not at all, that Man in whom Pride is Habitually prevalent, has not the leaſt Grain of Chriſtian Humility; The Gentleman therefore muſt find out ſome other <hi>Salvo</hi> againſt the next time.</p>
            <p>The Vindicator took notice of a blunder in the Citizen in calling the ſame Perſon, Sceptical, a Slighter of our Religion, Obſtinate and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thought Sceptical and Obſtinate, did not jump well together; This Gentleman endeavours to help him here too, and ſays <hi>T.W.</hi> intended theſe as ſo many ſeveral Characters, and did not intend to unite them all in one Perſon; But it is certain he did, he ſpeaks in the ſingular number, if thou be Sceptical — I ſhall altogether glory in thy Scoffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are all joined together no disjunctive particle betwixt them, all lodged in one ſingle Perſon, in a diſtinct Paragraph, as a third Man diſtinct both from the Church-man and Diſſenter, and this is ſo plain, that Alderman himſelf, (as this Author calls him) was too honeſt to deny it.</p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:93151:63"/>
            <p>The Queſtion concerning the ninth Article of the Creed; and in what ſence <hi>T. W.</hi> ſets it up as a Standard of Controverſie, is fully manifeſted in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to this Paper; And 'tis a very groundleſs ſuggeſtion, that we have any deſign to lay it aſide, that we may impoſe whatever Notions we pleaſe upon the World, we very well approve of the Creeds, and have ſubſcribed to them, and to the Doctrine of the Church, as laid down in the Articles, and it were to be wiſhed your own Miniſters kept as cloſe to thoſe Articles in their Preaching as ours do. The Vindicator has been already defended in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions he took at <hi>T. W</hi>'s date of the Origination of the Catholick Church; This Gentlaman ſays he ſpoke of it under the denomination of Chriſtian, which is very falſe, as thoſe that read the paſſage will ſee, however the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman is beholden to his brisk Champion, for he'll ſay any thing in the World to help him at a dead lift.</p>
            <p>He puts the queſtion, <hi>Whether when our Saviour ſaid, upon this Rock I will build my Church, he did not ſpeak of it as yet unbuilt?</hi> I anſwer, if by unbuilt, he means unfiniſhed, it is true, for the Church Univerſal is a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in fieri,</hi> and will not be compleated till the End of the World; But if by unbuilt, he means unbegun, I ſay there is no reaſon ſo to underſtand the words of our Saviour, for he has been building his Church upon the ſame Rock there ſpoken of, from the Fall of Man, but I am loth to ſpend time upon ſuch quibbles, if the Gentleman had mentioned the Chriſtian Church, or if he had not ſaid a few Lines before, that the Angels were the moſt glorious Members of the Church, I dare ſay the Vindicator would not have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it,
<note place="margin">Review. <hi>p.</hi> 35.</note> nor have blamed him no more than <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Jerome,</hi> for ſpeaking of the Chriſtian Church in its infancy; And though the Vindicator acknowledges the Apoſtles and Diſciples were the Church, he did not ſay the whole Church, much leſs that the Church then had its firſt exiſtence, I hope when theſe Gentlemen call the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Church, they do not mean the Church Univerſal.</p>
            <p>I deſire this Gentleman to give us ſome better proof than his bare Word, that ever the Apoſtles impoſed upon the Diſciples things indifferent,

            <p>The Vindicator bewails the ſlow Progreſs the Goſpel has made in the World, and imputes it in part to the needleſs Ceremonies, with which Men have encumbred it, and want of Perſonal worth in the managers; To this he replies, <hi>The Divines of the Church of</hi> England <hi>are no way concerned in it;</hi> No? What! not when there is ſo much notorious Debauchery amongſt us, that inſolently out-faces all the Letters and Orders whereby our Pious King and Queen have ſtirred up Magiſtrates and Miniſters to do what they can for the ſuppreſſion of it? And yet theſe Gentlemen ſee no want of ſucceſs of the Goſpel in <hi>England,</hi> but are for recommending to the Diſſenters a Journey to <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Tartary;</hi> Alaſs Man! The deſign of the Goſpel is not onely to

            <p>The Citizen acknowledged that in the Primitive times there was a multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Churches, by reaſon of the increaſe of Believers, The Vindicator was well enough pleaſed to hear him ſay, that the increaſe of Believers will make it neceſſary to multiply Churches, for according to the Epiſcopal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del there may be thouſands of Congregations, and Millions of Souls, and all but one Church under one Biſhop ſtill, the Gentleman now muſt mend it a little, and he puts in diſtance of place, as that which muſt be added to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of Believers, but ſtill, if a Biſhop may be Paſtor of a Thouſand Pariſhes, ſome of them a hundred Miles diſtant, and may do his work by Delegates, I ſee no Reaſon (as the Vindicator ſpeaks) why we may not have one Biſhop in a Nation, or one over all the World; He that can delegate one part of his Work, may delegate the whole, and then it is but multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Delegates, and he may have a Dioceſs as Univerſal, as that of the old Gentleman at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He requires a Scripture inſtance to prove that when believers grow too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous for one aſſembly, a Colony muſt be ſent out under Independent Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; But he ſhould rather prove, that ſuch a Colony muſt be ſtill in dependance upon the former, for if ſuch a Colony deſire to have a Biſhop and Presbyters of its own, thoſe that refuſe to ſuffer it, muſt be able to give ſome good reaſon for it; And to keep all new aſſemblies in dependance upon the firſt Church, would make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Miſtreſs of the Catholick Church, as <hi>Rome</hi> pretends; This Gentleman tells us, there may be a multiplication of Independant Churches, for ſuch are the Epiſcopal, and he ſays, he is not for Acring a Dioceſs, or contending about the Extent, and therefore I ſuppoſe if it ſhould be no bigger than a Pariſh, there's no harm done to the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Epiſcopacy; What need therefore of proving by Scripture that a new Colony muſt be an Independent Church, when the Author himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges it may be ſo, and if it deſire to be ſo, I know no body has power to hinder it, unleſs it be the Civil Magiſtrate; And how far it is within his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſiliction I ſhall not diſpute.</p>
            <p>The Magnitude of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> has been often debated, and before any thing can be concluded from thence, on the behalf of Prelacy,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93151:64"/>they muſt tell us, how many of thoſe Converts, we read of, were conſtant Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſtated Members of that Church; For if the greateſt part of them might be of thoſe that came thither at the Feaſt of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt</hi> it will ſpoil the Demonſtration; And they muſt alſo prove that they were under the Government of one Biſhop; And asking queſtions is not proving that it was ſo. At that time we read of ſuch numerous Converts, they had the Apoſtles amongſt them, who taught them from Houſe to Houſe, and we have no account of their being under the Government of one Biſhop, but what comes from <hi>Hegiſippus,</hi> and an obſcure <hi>Clement</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of no Authority.</p>
            <p>And it ought to be conſidered, that if the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were ſo very numerous, it is ſtrange they could all be received in ſo ſmall a place as <hi>Pella;</hi>

               </q> If he means Independent in Point of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment one over another,
<note place="margin">Vind. of Prot. Princ. <hi>p.</hi> 71.</note> the Epiſcopal Churches are all Independent in that ſence; (as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> very well proves) and therefore by this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93151:64"/>talk, cannot be United into one Body; If he means Independent in Point of Communion, I know no Churches that pretend to it.</p>
            <p>He affirms that Biſhops ſucceed the Apoſtles, in their Authority over the Presbyters and People, <hi>For,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe that any branch of Authority given by our Saviour to his Apoſtles died with them.</hi> But this would prove too much, for then we muſt have ſome Supream Officers in the Church, that have Power over Biſhops,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Review, <hi>p.</hi> 39.</note> as well as over Presbyters and People, for ſo had the Apoſtles; and we may retort his following words upon himſelf, <hi>If their Authority over the Biſhops expired with their Perſons, why ſhould that over Presbyters continue after them, unleſs he will ſuppoſe that the Inferiour Clergy are the only Perſons that need the Regulation of Superiours, all Multitudes muſt have Governours, and the Biſhops are certainly too numerous a Populace to be all Independent:</hi> Now let the Gentleman give us an Anſwer to this, and it will ſerve very well for an Anſwer to himſelf; It does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to ſhew that the Apoſtles Commiſſion was only a Patent for Life; but if any Perſons now-a-days ſhall pretend to have a Patent for the Apoſtleſhip, it behoves them to produce it well atteſted.</p>
            <p>The Vindicator obſerved, that the Authority of the Apoſtles was Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and the ſame over all Churches; and this Surveyor ſays, <hi>The Biſhops ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them in the ſame Authority, only the exerciſe thereof is limited by humane Agreements,</hi> and asks the Vindicator, whether a Biſhop be not as truly a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and a Presbyter as truly a Presbyter, in any other Man's Dioceſe or Pariſh as in his own?</p>
            <p>But here he puts things together, that ſhould be kept diſtinct; a Biſhop in the received and ordinary ſence of the word is a Relative term, and always connotes a Biſhoprick, either in Poſſeſſion or Title, as his Charge and Cure; and therefore though he be Biſhop in another Man's Dioceſe, he is not Biſhop of that Dioceſe; indeed, as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, he may Preach, and Adminiſter the Sacraments any where that Providence caſts him, and gives him an opportunity of ſo doing: and if this be all the Epiſcopal Power they pretend to, we will allow it to be as Univerſal as they pleaſe; but the Power of Juriſdiction over Miniſters and People, which they call the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Power, they have not any where but in their own Dioceſes, and yet even that Power the Apoſtles had all the World over, and could not be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it by any Humane Agreements whatſoever.</p>
            <p>By this Notion our Gentleman has advanced, the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> has no more Authority in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> than the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Review <hi>p.</hi> 40.</note> but what is founded on Humane Agreements, and what thanks his Dioceſan will give him for ſuch a Doctrine, I cannot tell; for he afterwards acknowledges, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> has no Authority at all in <hi>England,</hi> which makes the whole Power of our Biſhops to depend upon Humane Agreements, without which, he that has none at all, would have as much as they.</p>
            <p>Or perhaps it is liable to a worſe Conſequence than that; for if every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop has Univerſal Power in all Dioceſes, by the Grant of Chriſt, and is only
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93151:65"/>reſtrained in the Exerciſe thereof by Humane Agreements: then may the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> with Apoſtolical Authority make Canons for all <hi>England,</hi> and Excommunicate us all if we receive them not, for Chriſt gave him Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Power, only it was limited by Humane Agreements which he never agreed to, and if he had, that could not render his Act unauthoritative, but only irregular; Only, the beſt on't is, any Biſhop in <hi>England</hi> may make Canons for <hi>Rome</hi> too, and Damn them all, (Pope and Cardinals, and all) if they will not obey.</p>
            <p>I would gladly underſtand this Doctrine a little better, and therefore I beg the favour of this Gentleman, to tell me, what Agreements theſe are of which he ſpeaks; where and when made, and by whom? Are they only made by the Biſhops amongſt themſelves? or had the People a hand therein? or does he mean the Laws of the Land? If Biſhops can by mutual Agreement ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Exerciſe of their Power, why may they not by the like Agreements, conſtitute one to be Head over them all.</p>
            <p>I wiſh this Gentleman would go to School to a learned Doctor of his own Church, though he was not in Communion with him in theſe Notions; yet I hope no Schiſmatick for all that;
<note place="margin">Treat. of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, <hi>p.</hi> 120, 121.</note> 'tis the worthy Dr. <hi>Iſaac Barrow,</hi> whoſe words are, <q>The Offices of an Apoſtle and Biſhop are not in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture well conſiſtent; for the Apoſtleſhip is an extraordinary Office, charged with the Inſtruction and Government of the whole World, and calling for an anſwerable Care (the Apoſtles being Rulers, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, ordained by God, Rulers not taking ſeveral Nations and Cities, but all of them in common intruſted with the whole World) but Epiſcopacy is an ordinary ſtanding charge affixed to One place, and requiring a ſpecial Attendance there, who (as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith) do ſit and are employed in one place: Now he that hath ſuch a General Care can hardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge ſuch a particular Office; and he that is fixed to ſo particular an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, can hardly look well after ſo General a Charge.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I need not repeat what has been ſaid about the Powers of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> what the Gentleman here alledges is anticipated and anſwered; He muſt prove that Presbyters may not do what <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> did; that they may not ordain, that they may not reprove one another for their Faults, as they have occaſion: He ſays, <hi>Theſe are the Powers that Biſhops have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed all along;</hi> and ſo have Presbyters too: and if exerciſe proves the Title, they muſt therefore be Biſhops alſo.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>The Congregational Invention allows of no ſuch Officers, the moſt ordinary Paſtors being all Independent, without ever a</hi> Timothy <hi>or</hi> Titus <hi>to Govern them, and therefore by Scripture ſtands condemned;</hi> and if it be ſo, I am ſure Epiſcopacy is involved in the ſame Condemnation; for the Biſhops are by their own Party accounted the only Paſtors, and the Inferiour Clergy are but their Curates, and yet theſe Paſtors have none to ſuperviſe them, but are as Independent as can be, there's no <hi>Paul</hi> to govern theſe <hi>Timothies</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>'s, and therefore their Churches are (to uſe his own words) plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apoſtolical Pattern.</p>
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:93151:65"/>
            <p>And Dr. <hi>Morrice</hi> has told us, That it is not eſſential to a Biſhop to have many Congregations under him, Biſhops may be Paſtors of ſingle Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, yea, they may not have one Presbyter under them,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Review,</hi> p. 60.</note> and yet be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſtill; for <hi>Milles</hi> the Martyr was a Biſhop, and yet had no Chriſtian in his Dioceſe; and yet I think there are few Paſtors of our Congregational Churches, but what have Presbyters under them, ſo that Epiſcopacy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency may very well comport together; for Epiſcopacy is Independent, and may be Congregational, and if the one be condemned by Scripture, the other muſt fall with it.</p>
            <p>He ſays, <hi>It is an idle fancy to ſuppoſe that the Office of</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>was itinerant; for then, ſays he, they were out of their Office when they were at home, the one in</hi> Epheſus, <hi>and the other in</hi> Crete. If by calling thoſe places their Homes, he would inſinuate that they were their proper Dioceſan Sees, where they were to reſide, 'tis a begging of the Queſtion, and every Body knows that's the way of Idle Perſons; it is as certain as our Bibles can make it, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was only to abide at <hi>Epheſus</hi> for a Seaſon, till <hi>Paul</hi>'s return out of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.14. after which he accompanied <hi>Paul</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> Chap. 4.13. from thence to <hi>Italy,</hi> Heb. 13.23. thence <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, he would ſend him to <hi>Philippi,</hi> Chap. 2.19. and we find him at <hi>Rome</hi> again, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.1.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Titus</hi> was ſo far from being reſident at <hi>Crete,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2.1, <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. 2 Cor. 2.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.8. 2 Tim. 4.10.</note> that he was commanded away to <hi>Nicopolis</hi> before Winter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12. he was ſent to <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> and came to him during his Impriſonment at <hi>Rome; Theſe Removes our Gent. would have us to think were their Epiſcopal Viſitations;</hi> but that would make the Dioceſes of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Creet</hi> to take in one another, and the whole Chriſtian World too.</p>
            <p>The Vindicator told <hi>T. W.</hi> that it would not agree with the Nature of a proper Succeſſion, that two Biſhops ſhould ſucceed one Apoſtle in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Power. This Gent. undertakes to prove it may, but by ſuch kind of inſtances as ſignifie nothing but his own inadvertency, <hi>viz. When two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are Heirs to one in the ſame Eſtate, the Law calls them</hi> Succeſſores par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarii: But this will not do, an Eſtate may be divided into a Thouſand Parts, and each of them have the Nature of an Eſtate ſtill; but the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Power is Univerſal, the ſame in all places, and diviſion here will make it another thing, according to the Account that Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> Dr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> and the beſt Proteſtant Writers give of the difference betwixt the Offices of Apoſtle and Biſhop: <hi>Paul</hi> as an Apoſtle had the ſame Power at <hi>Epheſus</hi> as at <hi>Crete,</hi> and if <hi>Timothy</hi> had ſucceeded in the Apoſtolical Power, he muſt have had ſo too.</p>
            <p>His Argument from the Diviſion of the Empire, is as defective as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Empires, how great ſoever, are limited within certain Bounds, and may be divided; it is not of the Nature of Imperial Power to be over all the World, as it was of the Apoſtolical; 'tis a vain thing to talk of any Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93151:66"/>to which the Apoſtolical Power was limited, they had equal Power in all Provinces and Parts of the World; and ſo muſt thoſe have too that ſucceed them in the Apoſtleſhip.</p>
            <p>The Vindicator alſo deſired to know how <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> could ſucceed <hi>Paul</hi> in his Apoſtleſhip, whilſt he was alive and in Plenitude of Power? This Gent. dares not undertake to unfold the Riddle; but <hi>ſo it was, chuſe what the Conſequences may be; for (ſays he) it is evident, the Apoſtle gave them a Plenitude of Power within their reſpective Charges, chuſe how much or how little he reſerved to himſelf;</hi> But pray, Sir, think better of it, a Plenitude of Power confined to a particular Charge and Province, is not the Plenitude of Apoſtolical Power; and if he reſerved any Power to himſelf within thoſe reſpective Charges, they had not the Plenitude of Power there, but were under his Apoſtolical Juriſdiction ſtill, and therefore did not ſucceed him in it; and if the Apoſtle reſerved to himſelf no Power over the Churches of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> he diveſted himſelf of his Apoſtleſhip; for he that had not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Power every where, had it no where.</p>
            <p>But the generous Surveyor is willing to compremiſe the matter betwixt them, T. W. <hi>muſt call the Biſhops Coadjutors only, whilſt the Apoſtles were living, and the Vindicator muſt give them the Title of Succeſſors after their Death.</hi> And if by Succeſſors, he means thoſe that after them were employed in the great Work of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, we grant all true Biſhops are their Succeſſors, but then we muſt put him in Mind that the Biſhops we read of in Scripture, were as much Biſhops before the Apoſtles Death as after, and therefore their Epiſcopal Power did not come to them by Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor did there at the Apoſtles Death any new Acceſſion of Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve upon them.</p>
            <p>It was therefore the moſt needleſs thing in the World to give the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Fathers any trouble in this Matter;
<note place="margin">Review, <hi>p.</hi> 42.</note> what if they call Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Apoſtles Succeſſors, ſo do we too, but do they ſay that they ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the Apoſtolical Power, or that the Apoſtleſhip was devolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the Right of Succeſſion, and yet it is that, <hi>T.

            <p>This Gentleman is not ſo thoughtful as he ſhould be when he ſays, <hi>We make it ſuch a mighty Myſtery for a Biſhop to Conſtitute his Succeſſour;</hi> if by Conſtituting, he means Naming or Appointing who ſhall be his Succeſſor, it is not impoſſible, ſuppoſing that God preſerve his Life, and the Church Conſent to that Appointment, tho' it be very inconvenient, and therefore forbidden by ancient Councils, but it is impoſſible for one Biſhop to devolve his whole Epiſcopal Power upon another, and yet to keep it himſelf in as great amplitude as ever.

W.</hi> made <hi>Linus</hi> ſucceed <hi>Peter</hi> in the See of <hi>Rome, Simeon James,</hi> in the Chair of <hi>Jeruſalem, Ananias</hi> (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſhould be <hi>Ananias</hi> the Cobler, of whom before) St. <hi>Mark</hi> in the Church of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and the account runs upon this Suppoſition that the Apoſtles, divided the World into ſeveral Provinces, and each of them was Biſhop of his proper diſtrict, and thoſe are called the Apoſtles Succeſſors, that came into their ſeveral Sees after their Death, and theſe being but ſuch a number, it would follow that the Succeſſion, muſt be only propagated in theſe Patriarchats; this the Vindicator mentioned as what would be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of <hi>T. W.</hi> his Scheme of Succeſſion, which he only erected in thoſe Churches, where he had an Apoſtle at the Head of the Roll; he never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that it was the Opinion of <hi>T. W.</hi> or any other, that none but the Patriarchs were the Apoſtles Succeſſors, but intimated, that ſuch a Succeſſion as <hi>T. W.</hi> deſcribed, would only be found in thoſe Churches.</p>
            <p>We now come to the proof of an uninterrupted Succeſſion, and let us ſee whether this Gentleman can demonſtrate it, better than his Alderman; it muſt be remembred that according to theſe men, the Truth of their Church, the Authority of their Miniſtry, the Validity of their Sacraments, and the Salvation of their Souls, depend upon this Line, and therefore it requires a proof ſuitable to the vaſt weight that is laid upon it; and whether he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us ſuch evidence let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>He tells us, <q>
                  <hi>As far as we have an account we find the Succeſſion regular, and we have no Reaſon to doubt of the like care in former Ages, we rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Providence of God, and the Care and Integrity of our Anceſtors, and no man ſhall bereave us of our Confidence.</hi>
               </q> Confidence indeed! in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, but what if God has never promiſed ſuch an unbroken line, how can we think his Providence ſhould be engaged to preſerves it, or where has he ſaid it ſhould be preſerved in <hi>England?</hi> and what if our Anceſtours who were Idolatrous Papiſts had no integrity, nor took no care of any thing but to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93151:67"/>flatter the Pope, and enrich themſelves, and enſlave the World; a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Faith and Hope, that depends upon the Care and Integrity of Apoſtate, Antichriſtian Biſhops and Churches.</p>
            <p>What he ſays about the Vindicators deſcending from <hi>Adam,</hi> as if it were as impoſſible for a Prieſt to come into a Biſhoprick without Epiſcopal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, as for a Man to come into the World, without ordinary Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is ſo perfectly ludicrous, that as I ſuppoſe it was only deſigned to make the Club merry, ſo I ſhall leave it wholly to them.</p>
            <p>But that which goes before muſt not be ſo ſoon diſmiſt, he pretends that we have as good Evidence of an uninterrupted Succeſſion of Miniſters Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copally ordain'd as of pure and genuine Scriptures,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Review, <hi>p.</hi> 44.</note> and (ſays he) although we have not the Original Manuſcripts to compare the One, nor entire <hi>Faſti</hi> in the other Caſe, yet unleſs any will produce matter of Fact to ſhew that we are deceived, no man ſhall bereave us of our Confidence.</p>
            <p>But this will ſatisfie no Body, but thoſe that are reſolved to be Confident right or wrong; for,</p>
            <p>That we have true Scripture is a thing much more capable of Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than that none of our Biſhops have ever wanted Epiſcopal Ordination; it is much more eaſie to impoſe an unordained Perſon upon a particular Church,
<note place="margin">Nor could men lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame temptations to the one, as to the other.</note> than a falſe Bible upon the whole World, in the latter all the World would be equally concerned to diſcover and reject the impoſture, in the other a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Dioceſs is only intereſted; in the one, they had a great number of Copies ſpread abroad, by which they might compare and try any that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them, in the other they might have nothing but the Credentials, or Certificates of Perſons dead or living remote, which might eaſily be forged, and they not able to find it out.</p>
            <p>And for the Authority of the Scriptures, we do not depend upon the ſingle Credit and care of the Antichriſtian Churches, but of many others, that have not been made ſo drunk with the Wine of her Fornication. We have the <hi>Greek, Armenian,</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Churches, to aſſure us of this great point, but as to the continued Epiſcopal Ordination of our Biſhops, we ſolely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the credit of a blind and deceitful Generation, that have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done all Mankind in deceiving the Nation and putting a thouſand cheats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World.</p>
            <p>In the matter and ſtile of the Scriptures themſelves, we have moſt excellent <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and Indications of their divine Original, but no ſuch inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Mark or Character of Divinity is found upon the whole Line and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>It was always accounted the moſt horrid Sin in the World to forge or adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate the Scriptures, but I have already proved in this Treatiſe that in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Ages, the Power of Ordination was ſometimes given to thoſe that were no Biſhops; and though this was one of the incroachments which the Popes made upon the rights of Epiſcopacy, as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> tells us, yet if they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed ſuch a power, it is greatly to be ſuſpected they did not fail to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it.</p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:93151:67"/>
            <p>Beſides, none ever pretended that the Salvation of mens Souls does abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely depend upon having a compleat and entire Canon of Scripture, but according to theſe men it does wholly lye upon an entire Line of Succeſſion.</p>
            <p>In theſe and many other Circumſtances, theſe two Caſes vaſtly differ; and he that has no more to ſay for the Authority of Scripture than this man has ſaid for his Line, would greatly betray the Honour of his Profeſſion, and he that would perſwade the World, that we have no better Evidences of the Truth of our Bibles, than of ſuch a Line, does the worſt Office imaginable to the Intereſts of Chriſtianity, and (to uſe his own Words) it is one of the ſlyeſt Libels upon Scripture that I have lately met with.</p>
            <p>Here again the buſineſs of the Abbot of <hi>Hye</hi> falls in our way, but having ſiſted it already, I ſhall not make Repetitions; This Gentleman would Salve and Patch up the Buſineſs by Suppoſitions. <hi>Suppoſe the Succeſſion of Biſhops from that Abbot were extinct, and true Biſhops called in to Conſecrate, then the Line would be pieced again:</hi> And yet all the Churches and Chriſtians, that lived under the Succeſſors of that Abbot were damned by their Doctrine; but what if they were not all extinct? which is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to prove, ſuppoſe that Line ſhould reach to our times, then all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it are Lay Impoſtors; I think the Biſhops ought, to oblige theſe men that talk at this rate, to demonſtrate that the Line is Right, or elſe Chaſtiſe them ſeverely, for making their Authority depend upon a Suppoſition impoſſible to be proved.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman denies, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> allows an Abbot Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter to Conſecrate a Biſhop, and makes challenges, and oppreſſes his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with Citations out of the Schoolmen; and indeed to give him his due, he has endeavoured all along by the redundancy of the Margin to make amends for the emptineſs of the Page, which looks like a ſhallow muddy ſtream, hemm'd in with a flowry Bank on each ſide; but who knows not that there is a manifeſt difference betwixt what the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> Practiſes, and what the Schoolmen determine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, upon the Note of Succeſſion, confeſſes that the Pope may by particular Delegation, impower Mytred Abbots, though meer Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, to ſupply the place of two of the Biſhops, in the buſineſs of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration; The Presbyters of <hi>Alexandria</hi> Conſecrated their Patriarch for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generations, <hi>Caſſianus</hi> tells us of a young man called <hi>Daniel,</hi>

            <p>He Points at ſome Canons, that forbid Presbyters to Ordain, and ſay, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Biſhop muſt be Ordained by three Biſhops at leaſt; but he that argues from their Canons to their Practice is a meer Sophiſter, as appears by the Conceſſion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> juſt now mentioned; and he may as well ſay, no
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93151:68"/>Biſhop ever obtained the Promotion,

<note place="margin">Tit. 1.7, 8.</note> Unclean, or Quarrelſome, becauſe by very Authentick Canons, ſuch are declared uncapable of the Office.</p>
            <p>His forty ſeventh, and three following Pages, are all built upon a miſtake, which this Gentleman, as well as <hi>T. W.</hi> fell into I know not how, as if the Vindicator ever denied the Validity of the Ordination of Schiſmaticks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he only argues, from his Adverſaries Aſſertion, that by Schiſm Men, and Societies, are utterly cut off from the Catholick Church, and have no place, nor Intereſt therein, and then I am ſure it will follow that they cannot be the Subjects of Apoſtolical Power, which can never be found out of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church; I hope it has been ſufficiently proved in this Treatiſe, that this is the juſt Concluſion from ſuch premiſes, and to talk of a remaining Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, that includes the Power of Ordination in thoſe that are utterly cut off from the Church is perfect gibberiſh, and if this Gentleman thinks fit to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer what has been already ſaid to it, we ſhall willingly diſcourſe him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about it.</p>
            <p>In the fiftieth Page he ſpeaks like himſelf, <hi>We believe with St.</hi> Jerom <hi>that the Power of Ordination belongs only to the Biſhop, and your Ordinations made by Presbyters are void and null, and we take you for no more but Lay Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not much concerned, what this Gentleman believes of us, nor what he takes us for, but he ſhould have been juſt to St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> though he may think 'tis no matter, whether he be ſo to us or no; it would be very ſtrange, if St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſhould ſay any ſuch thing as he pretends, and we ſhould have been glad, to have ſeen the Paſſage cited, if he refers to that, <hi>Quid enim fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Epiſcopus, excepta Ordinatione, quod non facit Presbyter?</hi> that has been ſufficiently explained in theſe Papers already, to intend, not any diſtinct Power that Biſhops had by the Law of God, but what the Cuſtom and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Churches at that time had reſerved unto them.</p>
            <p>He tells us,
<note place="margin">Review. <hi>p.</hi> 50, 51.</note> of <hi>ſome nice Enquiries, that have been made into our Miſſion, and that they ſuſpect many of our firſt Apoſtles, from whom we derive our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, were never Ordained, and ſuppoſes the Vindicator had not met with this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</hi> And it may be he has not, and therefore 'tis ten to One, but it is falſe, for if it were true, the Diſſenters were much more like to know it, than ſuch as he, with all his nice Enquiries and Suſpicions.</p>
            <p>He wonders <hi>the Vindicator ſhould loſe ſo many pages againſt this Line of Succeſſion, which if it would do no good, would certainly do no harm.</hi> Ay, but it would do the greateſt harm in the World to the Intereſt of the Church and Chriſtianity; to make the Salvation of men depend upon ſuch a Line, and that's the Notion the Vindicator ſpends ſome pages upon, and he cannot do a better Office to the Church or Proteſtant Religion than to expoſe it, and if that be not done effectually already, by my Conſent, either he or ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe, ſhall ſpend as many pages more upon it.</p>
            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:93151:68"/>
            <p>We come now to the Vindicators account of Ordination, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is a publick Approbation of Miniſterial Abilities by competent Judges; This (ſays the Gentleman) is ſuch a way of making Clergy men as never was heard of before, will a publick Aprobation of a mans Abilities inveſt him in his Office, will a Teſtimonial from the Inns of Court make a man a Judge without a Commiſſion from the King?</p>
            <p>Now here he confounds Commiſſion and Inveſtiture together, as if they were the ſame thing which 'tis certain they are not; The Commiſſion always goes before the Inveſtiture, and 'tis that which gives the Power, and the Inveſtiture, is only neceſſary to the regular Exerciſe of that Power, which is given by the Commiſſion. If this Gentleman would have the World believe, that it is the Biſhops that give a Miniſter his Commiſſion and Miniſterial Power, as the King gives the Judge his Authority, he ſets up Epiſcopacy in the Throne of Chriſt, and is condemned by the Reformed Churches; it is Chriſt alone who grants the Commiſſion, in the great Charter of the Goſpel, wherein he has declared that he will have a ſtanding Miniſtry, and tells us, what the Miniſterial Qualifications are, and has promiſed to work them by his Spirit in Men, in Order thereunto; all the Ordainers do, is <hi>deſignare perſonam,</hi> to Point out the Perſon that has thoſe Qualifications, and this publick Deſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the mans own Dedication of himſelf to the Work is the Inveſtiture, and ſets the man apart to the regular Exerciſe of that Power, which Chriſt by his Charter without, and thoſe Qualifications within has given unto him.</p>
            <p>The Caſe is ſomething like to that of making a Perſon Mayor of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, the People or Burgeſſes have the Power of chooſing and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder or Steward the Power of Swearing him, and yet none of theſe confer the Authority, but only deſign the Perſon, who receives his Power from the Prince alone, by the Charter of the place, as his Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>It is the great command of God to his Church, that the Goſpel be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Religion Propagated, Churches Gathered, and Governed, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Adminiſtred; He has not named the Perſons that are to do this, but he has deſcribed them by their Qualifications, and Perſons ſo qualified if they find alſo a promptitude to undertake the Work (which I ſuppoſe is that which the Church of <hi>England</hi> means, when ſhe enquires of the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, whether they be moved by the Holy Ghoſt to undertake that Office are to ſeek for a regular Inveſtiture, and the Ordainers are commanded to inveſt them by a ſolemn Approbation, that is, declaring that they find in them thoſe Qualifications, by which the Goſpel deſcribes a true Miniſter of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We grant that this Inveſtiture is moſt regularly performed by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſhould not ordinarily be without them; which ſeems to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this Reaſon, (for all Gods commands are highly rational) the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are ordinarily to be thought, the moſt competent Judges; but as the Inveſtiture it ſelf is not of the Eſſence of the Power, but only requiſite to the due exerciſe of it; So it is not of the Eſſence of the Inveſtiture that it be
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93151:69"/>performed by Miniſters, but other competent Judges may do it where they cannot be had, or will not do it upon lawful Terms.</p>
            <p>This Caſe of Ordination has been very weil argued by the excellent Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (of whom <hi>England</hi> was not worthy) in his Diſputations of Church Government, and becauſe I do not know that any one has direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſaulted him in it, I would refer this Gentleman to it, where he will find it illuſtrated thus.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If the Soveraign Power make a Law, that there ſhall be Phyſicians Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed by a Colledge of Phyſicians to Practiſe in this Common Wealth, and deſcribe the Perſons that ſhall be ſo Licenſed; This plainly firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth that ſuch Perſons ſhall be Phyſicians, but ſecondly, <hi>de ordine,</hi> that they ſhall be thus Licenſed. So that if the Colledge ſhould Licenſe a Company of utterly inſufficient men, and murtherers that ſeek mens death, or ſhould refuſe to Licenſe the Perſons qualified according to Law, they may themſelves be puniſhed, and the qualified Perſons may act as authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by that which bindeth <hi>quoad materiam,</hi> and is by the Colledge, not by them fruſtrate <hi>quoad Ordinem;</hi> So it is in this Caſe in hand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a rational account of the matter, and ſuch as may give all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians full ſatisfaction in the Truth of their Churches Miniſtry and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without flying up into the Clouds, and inventing the Myſteries of an uninterrupted Succeſſion, indelible Characters, and ſuch like ſtuff.</p>
            <p>What has this Gentleman to Object againſt it, why? He tells us, no man can preach unleſs he be ſent, and no man can ſend him, but he that is Authorized for that purpoſe; If he means by this, that no man ought to Preach, but thoſe that are Ordained (and this he muſt mean, if he ſpeaks to the purpoſe) the Conſtant Practice of his own Church Confutes him, which allows men to preach ſeveral times before Ordination, that their Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may appear, and they may acquire a Title; but if no man can lawfully Preach till he be Ordained, they ought not to allow this upon any account whatſoever, not ſo much as to make experiment of their Abilities.</p>
            <p>I would ask this Gentleman, when your Candidates Preach before Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is there no Poſſibility, that their Preaching may do good to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſhould they not in Preaching principally intend their Edification? If not 'tis taking the Name of God in vain; but if they may do good, and ſhould make that their chief aim in thoſe Sermons, then the Gentleman muſt find out ſome other ſence for that Text he mentions, which has been already explained in the firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>He thinks, <hi>Ordainers are obliged to follow the Example of Chriſt, who when he ſent out his Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">Mat. 28.18.</note> recites his own Commiſſion, All Vower is given to me in Heaven and in Earth: Go therefore — as my Father ſent me, ſo I ſend you.</hi> But it is the higheſt piece of Arrogance in the World, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the ſame Power that Chriſt had in this matter; He had Power to inſtitute the Office, and give the Authority of the Miniſtry; Men have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Power of Inveſtiture, as the Biſhops in Crowning our Kings; and as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93151:69"/>Chriſt never made theſe Words of his the ſet form of Ordination, ſo 'tis-too bold for any Biſhop how great ſoever, to apply them to himſelf in that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>That which follows,
<note place="margin">Review, <hi>p.</hi> 52</note> about <hi>appointing Embaſſadors for Almighty God without his Order,</hi> is already in ſubſtance anſwered, if by appointing Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, he means giving the Commiſſion and Power, neither Lay-men nor Clergy-men muſt preſume to do it; if he means inveſting them that God has choſen, with the Ceremonies of Ordination, 'tis fit that the Miniſters ſhould do it, if they may be had, or will do it on lawful Terms, but if not, better it were omitted, than that the Embaſſy of Reconciliation ſhould not be delivered to the World; I ſuppoſe their unordained Candidates bring ſuch an Embaſſy to their hearers (I am ſure they ſhould do ſo) and if they do, then we have Embaſſadours, without an appointment in his Sence of the Word.</p>
            <p>The Caſes of Neceſſity which the Vindicator mentioned, are ſuch as may happen, and to neglect the publick Worſhip of God, in expectation of a Gift of Miracles, which I ſuppoſe he means, by the reviving of the <hi>Chariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi> would be a profane Omiſſion. He thinks to ridicule us out of it, by putting the Caſe concerning a company of Women caſt upon an Iſland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well, what if a man ſhould ſay, that the beſt qualified Siſter among them might be choſen by the reſt, as the Abbeſſs, to be moſt conſtantly employed in Prayer and Exhortation, till better help could be had; were not the Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians Converted by a Captive Maid;

The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> affirmed, the words of the Common-Prayer-Book intended, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Private Perſons to baptize in ſuch Caſes, and ſaid it was agreeable to the Practice of the Primitive Church, alledging the great numbers that were Baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Which it was improbable the Apoſtles alone could do, and added that ſome Fathers were of the ſame Opinion,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fuller Cent.</hi> 17. l. 10. p. 9.</note> and when the King oppoſed it, the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> replied, that to deny Private Perſons to Baptize in Caſe of neceſsity, were to Croſs all Antiquity and the Common Practice of the Church, it being a Rule agreed on by Divines, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is not of the Eſſence of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Their great Eccleſiaſtical Polititian Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſets himſelf to prove that Baptiſm by any man in Caſe of Neceſsity is valid,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccleſ. Pol.</hi> p. 320.</note> and ſays it was the Voice of the whole World heretofore, and (elſewhere) That God hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Miniſtry of Baptiſm unto ſpecial men, it is for Orders ſake in the Church, not that their Authority might add any force to the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Now is it not the moſt unaccountable perverſeneſs in the World to make Epiſcopal Ordination ſo indiſpenſibly neceſſary? when the moſt ſolemn acts of the Miniſtry (the Application of the Seals) are allowed by themſelves to thoſe that have no Ordination at all, yea to a Siſter, whether welll quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93151:70"/>or no, in which they have quite out-done us, no ſuch thing being ever practiſed in the Presbyterian Churches.</p>

               <hi>Ruffinus</hi> tells us, that when <hi>Frumentius</hi> by the Providence of God was advanced to ſome Power in the Realm during the Kings Minority, he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſought out ſuch as were Chriſtians among the Roman Merchants, and exhorted them to meet together and pray, which they did and when the Indians came amongſt them, they inſtructed them in the Chriſtian Faith, and all this was done before he took his Journey to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and tho' <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> will needs be ſo nice as to diſtiuguiſh betwixt Oratories and Churches, and betwixt Preaching and inſtructing I yet here was the great End of Churches and Biſhops and Sermons happily attained, <hi>viz.</hi> The Converſion and Inſtruction of Poor Souls, a greater Seal of Miſsion than that of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles, wherewith ('tis ſaid) <hi>Frumentius</hi> returned.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemans other inſtances, prove no more but that in the ſence of thoſe times, it was very deſireable to have Miniſterial Ordination and that they rather choſe to be at a great deal of pains than to want it, but it is not the deſireableneſs, but the neceſſity of it, that the Vindicator denied, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> you ſee, will ſtand by him in it; Nor was it his deſign to ridicule the Ceremony of laying on of Hands; But that fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that by ſuch contact, there is a tranſition of power from one to another, in a continued Line; The Presbyterians themſelves always uſe that Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical rite in their Ordinations, tho' they do not think it neceſſary to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of Authority.</p>

            <p>He charges the Vindicator with want of Sence or Integrity, in reporting the Notion of a Patriarchal Right to Soveraignty; But if he can explain that Notion any better 'twould have been a very obliging thing to have done it; I muſt confeſs I am as dull as the Vindicator in underſtanding it, and cannot imagine how that Patriarchal Right ſhould exiſt any where but in the Line of the Eldeſt Family in the World; For if at any time you ſet up a Younger Brother, it muſt be upon ſome other Title, not the Patriarchal, but either the expreſs Nomination of God, or Election, or Conqueſt, or the like; But to claim the Regal Power by Patriarchal Right, without pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leaſt to the Line of Primogeniture, is a thing I deſpair of ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; That this Patriarchal Right was aſcribed to our Kings in the Late Reigns, is too well known, and will not be ſo eaſily forgotten by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is denied by thoſe that then filled Mens Ears with it,

            <p>What he mentions <hi>p.</hi> 56. concerning the Decency of Ceremonies, has been obviated in the former part, and there he may learn from the Biſhops and Doctors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that the Worſhip of God is never the better performed for them, and therefore never the more decently, and Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> condemns him for a Superſtitious Fop that thinks otherwiſe, this caſe is therefore adjudged already;

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93151:72"/>have no certain cure (in ſuch places where the Civil Magiſtrate does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe) but by the Peoples conſent; This Gentleman tells us the conſent of the Miniſters and People of the Dioceſs is not neceſſary, — but it is left wholly to the diſcretion of the Church, and I wonder what that Church is, to whoſe diſcretion this is referr'd when the Miniſters and People are left out; will he ſay it is in the Power of the Biſhops of other Dioceſſes, to impoſe a Biſhop upon any, without the conſent of Miniſter and People; And muſt we by the Church underſtand the Biſhops alone without Miniſters and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as if they had nothing to do in thoſe matters that are left to the Churches Diſcretion; This lets us ſee what theſe Men drive at, and how gladly they would enſlave the whole World to the humours of a few, and thoſe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the wiſeſt or beſt of Men.</p>
            <p>That the Nomination of our Engliſh Biſhops is veſted in the King, is very pleaſing to Diſſenters, eſpecially under the Government of one ſo Wiſe and Good as ours is; But then we muſt ſay the Power they receive from the King and Laws, is not properly Spiritual Power; And we are willing to own them as having Humane Authority over us, <hi>circa Sacra,</hi> by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Governours, as far as by Law we are under their Juriſdiction; And certainly many of them are too wiſe to pretend to any more, ſince our Laws expreſly condemn ſuch pretenſions, as has been already proved, by the very Letter of the Law in that caſe.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman tells us <hi>The Vindicator ſhewed his Abilities, in mentioning</hi> Ignatius, <hi>who adviſes the Biſhop to hold frequent aſſemblies, and to enquire after all by their names, not deſpiſing the Men Servants or Maid Servants,</hi> and he would fain ſhew his Abilities, in enervating ſo plain evidence, and would impoſe upon us a great many Negatives and Peradventures, which we muſt help him to prove, We muſt prove, <hi>That thoſe Aſſemblies, met only in one place, that they were no more than ordinary Congregations, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop had no body to aſſiſt him in the remoter parts of his charge, that no man elſe acquainted him with the frailties and miſdemeanours of particular;</hi> Theſe and a great many more ſuch Negatives we muſt prove, which we are no way obliged to do, we inſiſt upon the plain words of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and he muſt prove his peradventures himſelf, or we ſhall take no notice of them; The Author of the Enquiry into the Conſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Primitive Churches, offers to prove that theſe Dioceſſes were no larger in the number of Church Members, than our preſent Pariſhes; But whether that be ſo or no, I will not be poſitive; For it is manifeſt enough, the firſt ſtep towards Prelacy, was committing the Government of the Church to one, which before was managed by ſeveral in common, the next was to make that Church as large and great as could be; By keeping new formed Congregations under their Juriſdiction; and we have early inſtances of ſuch Incroachments.</p>
            <p>Theſe Men take the Liberty of making words ſignifie any thing that ſerves their preſent purpoſe. If <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſay, the Presbyters are the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, there Presbyter muſt ſignifie Biſhop, for fear of ſpoiling

            <p>Though the Vindicator truſting perhaps to his memory, mentioned the Sacrament of the Euchariſt inſtead of Baptiſm, yet it amounts to the ſame thing, for if the Biſhop was to take the Confeſſions of all that were to be Baptiſed, his Dioceſs could not be of the ſame Model with ours, which ſuch a thing would be altogether impracticable; This Gentleman wonders <hi>the Vindicator ſhould be ſo nice in the Notion of Succeſſion,</hi> p. 19. <hi>And afterwards ſo looſe as to make it no more but conformity to the Apoſtles Model in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Worſhip,</hi> but the wonder will ceaſe, when he conſiders that in the former place, he took Succeſſion in the Sence <hi>T.

            <p>The Vindicator grants that for perſons wilfully to withdraw themſelves from ſuch Particular Churches, as are framed according to Goſpel Rules, and impoſe no new or needleſs terms of Communion, is to act Schiſmatically, becauſe it cannot be without breach of Charity; The Gentleman replies <hi>Yes it may through the Prejudices of Education, or want of Underſtanding,</hi> that is to ſay, they may wilfully withdraw for want of Underſtanding; If their ignorance be not wilful, it does not come up to the Caſe as the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator ſtated it, but if it be wilful ignorance, ſure there is ſomething of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs in it.</p>
            <p>His two laſt Pages are a very fit Epilogue for ſuch an Opera, he rakes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the inſtances of wickedneſs that can be, and the Reader muſt take it for granted, that the Diſſenters are the Criminals pointed at, though he does not think fit to ſay ſo; Such dealing and no other we have had from him all along; We deſire him the next time to ſpeak above board, let him name the particular Caſes and Perſons, and not by ſly inſinuations, prejudice the Minds of his Credulous Party, againſt thoſe who abhor ſuch things as much as himſelf.</p>

            <p>That the Reformation of this Land was encouraged by King <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII, rather upon private pique againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> than out of any hearty Love to the thing it ſelf, is too plain to be denied, &amp; that doubtleſs was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſhort &amp; uneven paces by which it then moved, nothing muſt be done but with a ſaving to the Politick Maximes and Intereſts of the Court;

            <p>His Son and Succeſſor the Glorious King <hi>Edward,</hi> engaged himſelf in the Cauſe upon a better Principle, and would in all probability have improved it to a good degree of perfection, had not the ſtiffneſs of ſome leading Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the ſhortneſs of that invaluable life, prevented him. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign, <hi>Miles Coverdale, John Hooper</hi> and others, who had fled beyond Sea upon the ſix Articles, returned into <hi>England;</hi> And finding how very defective the Reformation was, and how many Popiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Geſtures and Veſtments, were ſtill retained, could not conceal their diſſatisfaction;

            <p>The Unhappy differences betwixt <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hooper,</hi> about theſe things are ſufficiently known, and ſo is that happy agreement to which they came when they were Priſoners for the Truth in the <hi>Marian</hi> days; And by <hi>Ridleys</hi> Letter to <hi>Hooper</hi> it appears that his ſufferings had changed his Thoughts concerning thoſe by-matters as he calls them, for which in Proſperity he had ſo warmly contended, he confeſſeth it was <hi>Hoopers</hi> Wiſdom to reject them, and his Simplicity to urge them. <q>Your Wiſdom and my Simplicity I grant hath a little jarred.</q>

            <p>And that which made his Rigor the more blameable was, that he perſiſted in it, notwithſtanding the King's earneſt Requeſt to the contrary, firſt by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> then under his own Signet, wherein he highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Hooper</hi>'s Learning, Judgment, Diſcretion and Probity, and promiſes to ſave the Biſhops from all Penalties they might incur by paſſing over thoſe Rites and Ceremonies that were offenſive to his Conſcience, but inſtead of complying herewith, <hi>Hooper</hi> is ſent to Priſon; no wonder if this cauſed <hi>Ridley</hi> to make ſuch reflections upon himſelf, when he was under the like Confinement.</p>
            <p>The Learned Author adds, <q>That <hi>Ridley</hi> ſpoke theſe diminiſhing things of himſelf in the abſence of the Law when it was repealed;</q> but that I ſuppoſe does not in the leaſt alter the caſe; for if his contending with <hi>Hooper</hi> was juſtifiable at firſt, it would have remained ſo ſtill, and the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the action could not be changed by any thing <hi>[ex poſt-facto]</hi> but muſt needs ſtand good or bad as it was when firſt done; and under thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances no doubt it was reviewed when the ſimplicity thereof was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; and I fear it will not ſo well conſiſt with the honour that is due to the Memory of that bleſſed Martyr, to think that out of meer Complement to <hi>Hooper,</hi> he would diſapprove of what he had done, had he really believed he had done well in it: He that was ready to ſuffer the utmoſt extremity for the great Truths of Religion, would not upon any account have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted his Judicious Zeal, for the Unity of the Church, and Decency of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if he had ſo eſteemed of it; but his Sentiments were now changed, and that which before he thought to be Wiſdom and Zeal, he now confeſſes was ſimplicity.</p>
            <p>Whilſt this good Biſhop was thus acknowledging his weakneſs, and gladly embracing thoſe to whom he had been formerly ſomewhat troubleſome; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Brethren, who had eſcaped the Fiery Tryal, and were not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled enough to ſee their folly, werefomenting differences even in the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to which they fled.</p>
            <p>The moſt famous Congregation of Engliſh Exiles was ſeated at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> where they had a Church granted them by the Magiſtrates,
<note place="margin">Troubles of <hi>Frankfort,</hi> printed 1575</note> who required them to obſerve the Model of the French Churches in their Service, which they willingly conſented to, forbearing to anſwer aloud after the Miniſter,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93151:75"/>omitting the Litany, Surplice, and other Ceremonies as ſuperfluous and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious; inſtead of the Confeſſion in the Engliſh Liturgy, uſed another, better fitted to the preſent time and ſtate of Affairs, then ſang a Pſalm in Metre in a plain Tune, then the Miniſter prayed for the Divine Aſſiſtance, and ſo proceeded to the Sermon, then followed a prayer for all States, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for <hi>England,</hi> which ended with the Lord's Prayer, then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal of the Articles of our Belief, then another Pſalm, and the Miniſter concluded with the Bleſſing.</p>

            <p>When Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Throne, there ſeemed a fair proſpect of further Reformation and Union, and divers of the Biſhops that had been ſufferers, were willing to have promoted it; but others were ſtill tenacious of their Old Cuſtoms, and greatly affected External Pomp and Gallantry in Divine Service, and the Queen her ſelf was very much of that humour, as appears by <hi>Grindal</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Bullinger</hi> dated <hi>Auguſt</hi> 27.

            <p>
               <q>Here ſuffer me to tell you, that in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign our Adverſaries ſaw no hopes of retrieving their Affairs,
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Burnets</hi> Thankſgiving Serm. before the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Jan.</hi> 31. 1688.</note> which had been ſpoiled by Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Perſecution, but by ſetting on foot Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions amongſt Proteſtants, upon very inconſiderable matters, I my ſelf have ſeen the Letters of the Chief Biſhops of that time, from which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Queen's ſtiffneſs in maintaining ſome Ceremonies, flowed not from their Counſels, but from the practices of ſome diſguiſed Papiſts; And I have had in my hand the Original Journal of the lower Houſe of Convocation in the fifth year of that glorious Reign, in which the matter of the Ceremonies was firſt argued, and when it came to the Vote, it was carried by the greater Number of the Voices of the Members that were preſent, to lay down all thoſe Subjects of Conteſts, but the Proxies turned it to the ſeverer ſide.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How unhappy the Effects of this Act for Conformity were, (which in the Convocation turned upon ſo narrow a Point) may appear by the words of a worthy Perſon then living, which are theſe; <q>For ſome five years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before the Subſcription was urged,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> Plea of the Innocent, p. 206, 207</note> there was ſuch Unity amongſt the Miniſters, and they joyned together, in all places ſo lovingly and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, that many thouſands were converted from Atheiſm and Popery; but when Subſcription was urged, many godly worthy learned Preachers were ſilenced, and deprived, the Nation diſtracted, many good Perſons grieved and offended, and Papiſts and wicked men encouraged and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things were ſo obvious, that divers Lords of the Privy Council earneſtly ſollicited for Moderation; and in an excellent Letter to A.
<note place="margin">See the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at large in <hi>Fuller C.H.</hi> Book 9. p. 151.</note> Biſhop <hi>Whitgiſt,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſet forth, that a great number of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Zealous Preachers, were ſuſpended from their Cures, and the County of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and other Places, and many of their Rooms filled with Perſons, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of good Learning, nor good Name, but chargeable with great faults, as Drunkenneſs, Filthineſs, Gaming, Haunting of Ale-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein they earneſtly entreat the Prelates, to take ſome charitable conſideration of theſe Cauſes, that the People of the Realm may not be deprived of their Paſtors, being Diligent, Learned and Zealous, though in ſome Points Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, they may ſeem doubtful in Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Subſcribed by the Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> E. <hi>Warwick,</hi> E. <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> L. <hi>Howard, J.

            </p>
            <p>But they were put off with the common Anſwer, that the Miniſters were Factious, and Contemners of the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, and Authors of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93151:76"/>and muſt not be ſuffered to exerciſe their Miniſtry without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conformity.</p>

<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 174.</note> theſe things were taken notice of in Parliament, and the Honourable Houſe of Commons Paſſed ſome Bills in favour of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, but the Arch-biſhop was importunate with the Queen not to give her conſent, and ſo nothing was effected. Still the Nation grew more and more ſenſible of the ill Conſequences of the Biſhops proceedings, and in the year 1587. The Houſe of Commons preſented to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, a Petition in ſixteen Particulars, ſome againſt ſcandalous and inſufficient Miniſters, others deſiring the abatement of certain Oaths and Subſcriptions, tendred to perſons at their entrance on the Miniſtry, and yet not expreſly preſcribed by the Laws of the Realm, and that Miniſters might not be troubled for their omiſſion of ſome Rites,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 191.</note> preſcribed in the Book of Common Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And divers of the Lords approved of this Petition, and ſpoke to it; But the Arch-biſhop betook himſelf to his old Weapon, cries out the Church was a falling,
<note place="margin">O Dea. cert.</note> makes his Prayers to the Queen, calls her a Goddeſs, and carries the point againſt them all.</p>
            <p>Having thus baffled the Parliament, they proceed to the Impriſonment of Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> the ſilencing of Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> of whom Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> gives us ſuch a Character,
<note place="margin">P. 216.</note> as is no way to the credit of thoſe that dealt ſo harſhly with him; But this was not all, Mr. <hi>Udall,</hi> and divers others were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dye, for writing againſt the Male Government of theſe Eccleſiaſticks, which was now become a capital crime by one of the greateſt ſtretches of Law that ever was heard of in <hi>England.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 222.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We now come to the Reign of K. <hi>James</hi> the firſt, and here I think it may be ſeaſonable to wipe off that Dirt which <hi>T. W.</hi> has caſt upon the Vindicator, for ſaying, that when this Prince aſcended the Engliſh Throne, the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick party dreading leſt the Puritans ſhould have too great a ſhare of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; Bent all their Studies to create prejudices in him againſt them. The Citizen replies, <hi>The ill opinion which the King had of the Puritans, was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his own experience, and publiſhed long before he had any converſe with the Engliſh Biſhops; and tranſcribes a paſſage out of his</hi> ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΟΝ ΔΩΡΟΝ, <hi>where He ſays, Take heed my Son, of ſuch Puritans, very Peſts in the Church and Common-wealths, Whom no Deſerts can oblige,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But the Gentleman ought not to have inſulted over his Adverſary in ſuch opprobrious Language, till he had conſidered: That not a word of this was intended of the Engliſh Puritanes, concerning whom the Vindicator ſpoke; For this Prince had but a little while before writ three Letters to Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> in favour of them, and therein ſpeaks very honourably of Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> and Mr. <hi>Udal,</hi> who were eſteemed the Leading Men of that party; And kindly interceeded for thoſe that Diſſented from the Biſhops, in the things at that time controverted amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Nor by the word Puritan did the King mean the Presbyterians, as ſuch, if we may believe his own words, in the Preface to the aforeſaid Book; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93151:76"/>he declares, That the Name Puritan did properly belong to that Sect amongſt the Anabaptiſts called <hi>The Family of Love;</hi> 
               <q>Becauſe, ſays he, they think themſelves Pure, and in a manner without Sin, the only true Church, and only worthy to partake of the Sacraments, of this ſpecial Sect I prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally mean: when I ſpeak of Puritans, divers of them, as <hi>Brown, Penry,</hi> and others, having at ſundry times come into <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſaw their Popple;— And indeed, I give this Title to ſuch Brain-ſick and heady Preachers, their Diſciples and Followers, who refuſing to be called of that Sect, yet parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate too much with their Humours, in maintaining the above-mentioned Errors; and (the King further adds) I Proteſt upon my Honour, I did not mean it generally of all thoſe Preachers or others, that like better the ſingle Form of Policy in our Church, than of the many Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> or that are perſwaded that their Biſhops ſmell of a Papal Supremacy; No, I am ſo far from being contentious in theſe things, that I equally love and honour the Learned and Grave Men of either Opinion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And that thoſe called Puritans at that time in <hi>England,</hi> were not ſuch Perſons as are here deſcribed, appears ſufficiently, from the earneſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours both of the Houſe of Commons and Lords of the Privy Council on their behalf, and the different account they give of them, who muſt needs be acknowledged very competent Judges; and it is obſervable, that the Familiſts in <hi>England</hi> took notice of this cenſure of the King's,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fuller</hi> Church Hiſt. <hi>Book</hi> 10, <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note> and in their Petition to him when he came into <hi>England,</hi> they diſown all Affinity with the Puritans, and ſpeak reproachfully of them under that Title themſelves.</p>
            <p>I hope this will abundantly acquit the Old Engliſh Puritans from being the Perſons aimed at in thoſe Royal Reflections, and therefore notwithſtanding any thing in that Book, it may be very true that the Biſhops flattered that King into an ill Opinion of them.</p>
            <p>That ſome of our Engliſh Prelates endeavour'd to do very ill Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and Presbyterian Party even before he came into <hi>England,</hi> is moſt certainly true, and it cannot be imagined that they would be leſs buſie when they had him amongſt them, Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> was more than ordinary active in ſuch Deſigns, as appeared amongſt other things by a Letter from one <hi>Norton</hi> a Stationer in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> directed for him, and intercepted;

The ſame Biſhop writ frequent Letters to Mr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Adamſon,</hi> the Titular Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> (which were many of them intercepted) wherein he ſtirs him up to Extol and Praiſe the Church of <hi>England,</hi> above all others, and to come up to <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 259.</note> aſſuring him that he would be very welcome, and well rewarded by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:93151:77"/>
            <p>This <hi>Adamſon</hi> had compoſed a Declaration, which paſſed under the King's Name, wherein the whole Order of the Kirk was greatly traduced and condemned; The Commiſſioners of the General Aſſembly complained to the King of the many falſe Aſperſions contained therein, which were ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that the King diſowned it, and ſaid, It was not his doing, but the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, and prudently diſcarded that great Favourite, and gave the Rents of the Biſhoprick to the Duke of <hi>Lenox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The poor Gentleman thus abandoned, profeſſes himſelf to be truly Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for what he had done, and makes a full Recantation which he Subſcribed in the preſence of a great many Witneſſes, and directs it to the Synod con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd at St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s; <q>Confeſſing, That he had out of Ambition, Vain-Glory and Covetouſneſs, undertaken the Office of an Archbiſhop; That he had laboured to advance the King's Arbitrary Power in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Proteſted before God that he was commanded to write that Declaration by the Chancellor, the Secretary, and another great Courtier, and that he was more buſie with ſome Biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> in Prejudice of the Diſcipline of the Kirk, partly when he was there, and partly by Mutual Intelligence than became a good Chriſtian, much leſs a Faithful Paſtor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now although the King fondly adhered to ſuch kind of Men, whilſt he hoped to advance his Prerogative thereby, yet when he began to perceive the ill Effects of ſuch Conduct,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> Preface.</note> he ſtill deſerted them, and in thoſe prudent Intervals, would freely declare his good Opinion of the Presbytery, and their Form of Government, particularly in the National Aſſembly, 1590. <q>He thank'd God that he was King of ſuch a Country, wherein, ſays he, there is ſuch a Church even the ſincereſt Church on Earth, <hi>Geneva</hi> not excepted, ſeeing they keep ſome Feſtival Days, as <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and what have they for it? As for our Neighbours in <hi>England,</hi> their Service is an ill mumbled Maſs in Engliſh, they want little of the Maſs but the Liftings: Now I charge you, my good People, Barons, Gentlemen, Miniſters, and Elders, that you all ſtand to your Purity, and Exhort the People to do the ſame; and as long as I have Life and Crown, I will maintain the ſame againſt all deadly.</q>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93151:77"/>of them with Sorrow to their Graves, and the whole Diſcipline of the Church was over-thrown, notwithſtanding the King's parting Promiſe to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Nonconformiſts in <hi>England</hi> were ſo far from being brought over by the Severities of the former Reign, that they drew up a Petition about this time Signed by Seven hundred and fifty Miniſters, deſiring Reformation of certain Ceremonies and Abuſes in the Church, which <hi>Fuller</hi> gives us at large; this was deſigned to have been preſented before the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> but was deferr'd till after.</p>
            <p>The Relation of this (ſo much talk'd of) Conference, as <hi>Fuller</hi> reports it out of <hi>Barlow,</hi> is juſtly ſuſpected of great Partiality, and the Hiſtorian him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpeaks doubtfully of it; and yet even in that we have a plain Indication of what temper the Court and Biſhops were: It looks very odd, that when the King had allow'd ſeveral of Dr. <hi>Reynold</hi>'s Exceptions, he ſhould threaten if they had no more to ſay, He would make them to Conform, or hurry them out of the Land, or do worſe; a poor buſineſs! for a Prince to menace his own Subjects for Non-conformity to that which himſelf had formerly called an Ill-mumbled Maſs in Engliſh, and even now acknowledged, wanted ſome Reformation.</p>
            <p>But we have this Matter ſet in a truer Light, by Mr. <hi>Patrick Galloway,</hi> in his Account of it from <hi>London</hi> to the Presbytery of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <q>Beloved Brethren, after my hearty Commendations, theſe Preſents are to ſhew you, that I received Two of your Letters; One directed to His Majeſty, the other to my Self for my Peruſal, the ſame I read, cloſed and three days before the Conference, delivered into His Majeſties Hand, and received it back again after ſome ſhort Speeches, upon thoſe words in your Letter, <hi>the Groſs Corruptions of this Church,</hi> which were then expounded; and I was aſſured, all Corruptions diſſonant from the Word of God or contrary thereunto, ſhould be amended: The Twelfth of <hi>January</hi> was the day of Meeting, at which time the Biſhops were call'd upon, and gravely deſired to adviſe upon all the Corruptions of this Church, in Doctrine, Ceremonies and Diſcipline; and as they would anſwer it to God in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to His Majeſty upon their Obedience, that they ſhould return the Third day after, which was <hi>Saturday.</hi> Accordingly they returned to His Majeſty, and when the Matter was propounded to them, as before, they anſwered, All was Well. And when His Majeſty with great fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency brought inſtances to the contrary, they upon their Knees with great earneſtneſs, craved that nothing ſhould be altered, leſt the Popiſh Recuſants puniſhed for Diſobedience, and the Puritans puniſhed by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation <hi>ab officio &amp; beneficio,</hi> for Nonconformity, ſhould ſay, they had juſt Cauſe to inſult upon them, as Men who had endeavoured to bind them to that which by their own Mouths now was confeſs'd to be Erroneous. After five Hours Diſpute had by His Majeſty againſt them, and his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

               </q> but it appears by the reſult, their importunity overcame him at laſt.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> obſerves, That whereas before this Conference, it was diſputable, whether the North where he long lived, or the South, whither he lately came, would prevail moſt on the King's Judgment in Church Government, now this Queſtion was clearly decided. I hope now the Vindicator may be allowed to have ſome <hi>Grains of Shame and Modeſty common to Humane Nature,</hi> though he ventured to ſay, That the Engliſh Prelates flattered King <hi>James</hi> into an ill Opinion of the Puritans, and the thing is not ſo plain or known a Contradiction as the Citizen pretends; and for him to tell the World at this time a day of the famous Piety and Virtue of that Prince, is ridiculous enough. Alas, the Hiſtory of his Reign is too well known; his Contending with Parliaments; his Encouraging of Papiſts; his Secret Articles upon the Treaties with <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> his greedy Deſire of Arbitrary Power; his Proſtituting the Honours, and Waſting the Treaſures of the Nation, after a moſt inglorious manner, produced thoſe ill Effects, under which theſe Kingdoms have laboured and languiſhed ever ſince, till by the late happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution our Antient Rights and privileges were raiſed out of the Grave, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſed, and ſettled upon their true Baſis once more.</p>
            <p>The Unhappy Government of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, is now ſufficiently Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled; eſpecially by <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s Impartial Collections. The Vindicator briefly hinted at thoſe Irregular and Arbitrary Practices, that forced the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to take up Arms for the Defence of their Liberties, and for reſcuing the King out of the hands of thoſe Councellors that had ſo fatally miſled him; <hi>T. W.</hi> calls this <hi>Notorious Calumny, and ſays, he could anſwer all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances particularly, but he refers to the Rolls and Acts of Parliament;</hi> The Vindicator is willing to joyn iſſue with him here, and appeals to the ſeveral Petitions, Remonſtrances and Speeches made in Parliament as they ſtand upon Record in the Journals of both Houſes, and they are now made ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that no Man but one who has no Reputation to loſe, would have offered to deny that which all the Nation that can read, Books, know to be true. And I will alſo tell him, that there is not one paſſage mentioned by the Vindicator concerning the Male Adminiſtration of that King, but what he may find in the <hi>Supplement to</hi> Baker<hi>'s Chronicle,</hi> a Hiſtory never ſuſpected for Diſloyalty, but evidently partial the other way.</p>
            <p>The Vindicator renew'd the Challenge to Name four Perſons in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Burnet <hi>tells us, the Duke of</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton <hi>was diſſatisfied with the Courſes ſome of the Biſhops had followed before the Troubles began, and could not but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their firſt riſe to the Provocations that had been given by them,</hi> Memoirs, <hi>p.</hi> 408.</note> that were not in full Communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi> when the War began: It is true, many of them that were for Epiſcopacy, were highly offended at the Behaviour of ſome of the Biſhops, as appears by the Speeches of the Lords <hi>Falkland</hi> and <hi>Digby,</hi> both great Royaliſts; and for my part, I deſire no other Evidence of the intolerable Uſurpations of the <hi>Laudenſian</hi> Party,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93151:78"/>than what thoſe Noble Lords have given us, which being now in ſo many Hands, by the Publiſhing the third part of <hi>Ruſhworths</hi> Collections I will not tranſcribe.</p>
            <p>The Nonconformiſts indeed generally joyned with the Parliament in that Cauſe, which was doubtleſs as juſt and neceſſary, when firſt undertaken as ever was carried upon the Point of a Sword; But that it was without the leaſt deſign upon the Kings Perſon, their Solemn League and Covenant plainly proves, and the many Declarations, and Remonſtrances which they afterwards made, when they ſaw new deſigns laid and purſued.</p>
            <p>In the Year, 1648. When the Republican Faction was at the higheſt, the Miniſters called Presbyterian, in and about <hi>London,</hi> fearing that which afterwards happened, boldly Publiſhed a Vindication of themſelves, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the People, part of which, I ſhall here Tranſcribe to let the World ſee, how ſhamefully they have been abuſed about the Death of that King, their Words are theſe.</p>

                  </note> becauſe there are many who very confidently (yet moſt unjuſtly) charge us, to have been formerly inſtrumental toward the taking away the Life of the King; and becauſe alſo there are others, who in their Scurrilous Paſquils and Libels (as well as with their Virulent Tongues) repreſent us to the World as a Bloody Seditious Sect, and Traiterous Obſtructors, of what all the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly People of the Kingdom do earneſtly deſire for the eſtabliſhing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Peace in that we ſtick at the Execution of the King, while yet we are (as they falſly affirm) content to have him Convicted and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, all which we muſt and do from our Hearts diſclaim, before the whole World.</p>
               <p>For when we did firſt engage with the Parliament (which we did not till called thereunto) we did it with Loyal Hearts, and Affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King and his Poſterity; not intending the leaſt hurt to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but to ſtop his Party from doing further hurt to the Kingdom, not to bring his Majeſty to Juſtice, (as ſome now ſpeak) but to put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better Capacity to do Juſtice, to remove the wicked from before him, that his Throne might be eſtabliſhed in Righteouſneſs; not to Dethrone and Deſtroy him, which we fear is the ready way to the Deſtruction of all his Kingdoms.</p>

            <q>
               <p>That which put any of us on at firſt to appear for the Parliament was, the Propoſitions and Orders of the Lords and Commons in Parliament (<hi>June</hi> 10. 1642.) for bringing in of Money and Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherein they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us that whatſoever ſhould be brought in thereupon, ſhould be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon no other occaſion, than to maintain The Proteſtant Religion, The Kings Authority, and His Perſon in his Royal Dignity, the Free Courſe of Juſtice, the Laws of the Land, the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament, againſt any force which ſhall oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>As for the preſent actings at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſince the time that ſo many of the Members were by force ſecluded, divers impriſoned and others thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, withdrew from the Houſe of Commons (and there being not that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the two Houſes as heretofore) we are wholly unſatisfied therein, becauſe we conceive them to be ſo far from being warranted by ſufficient Authority, as that in our Apprehenſions, they tend to an actual Alteration, if not Subverſion, of that which the Honourable Houſe of Commons in their Declaration, of <hi>April</hi> 17. 1646. have taught us to call the Fundamental Conſtitution and Government of this Kingdom, which they therein aſſure us (if we underſtand them) they would never alter.</p>
               <p>Yea, we hold our ſelves bound in Duty to God, Religion, the King, Parliament and Kingdom, to profeſs before God, Angels and Men, That we verily believe, that which is ſo much feared to be now in Agitation, the taking away the Life of the King, in the preſent way of Trial, is contrary to the Word of God, the Principles of the Proteſtant Religion (never yet ſtained with the leaſt drop of the Blood of a King) the Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Government of this Kingdom, as alſo to the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Proteſtation of <hi>May</hi> 5.1641. and the Solemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; from all or any of which Engagements, we know not any Power on Earth, able to abſolve us or others.</p>
               <p>Therefore according to our Covenant, we do in the Name of the great God (to whom all muſt give a ſtrict account) warn and exhort all who either more immediately belong to our reſpective Charges, or any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on our Miniſtry, or to whom we have adminiſtred the ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (that we may not by our Silence, ſuffer them to run into that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking Sin of Perjury) to keep cloſe to the ways of God, and the rules of Religion, the Laws and their Vows, in their conſtant maintaining the true Reformed Religion, the Fundamental Conſtitution and Government of this Kingdom, as alſo in preſerving the Priviledges of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Union between the two Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to mourn bitterly for their own Sins, the Sins of the City, Army, People and Kingdom, and the miſcarriages of the King himſelf (which we cannot but acknowledge to be many and great) in his Government that have coſt the Kingdoms ſo dear, and caſt him down from his Excellency, into a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid pit of Miſery almoſt beyond Example; and to pray that God would give him effectual Repentance, and ſanctifie that bitter Cup of Divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93151:79"/>that Divine Providence hath put into his hand; and alſo that God would reſtrain the Violence of men that they may not dare to draw upon themſelves and the Kingdom the Blood of their Soveraign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>This was back't with a Letter to the General, and his Council of War to the ſame effect; and yet all this has not been ſufficient to defend them from the malicious ſlanders of men, that either were then unborn or had not the Courage, to run thoſe hazards for the ſake of their unfortunate Prince as they did. The deplorable Death of this King, has been made great uſe of in the Late Reigns, to run down Diſſenters, and to juſtifie thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful Laws that have been made and executed againſt them; and to make it the better ſerve ſuch deſigns, they have made the higheſt Panegyricks upon that Prince, and his extraordinary Piety and Devotion, in which they have commonly taken their Text out of ΕΙΚΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΗ, a Book which next to the Bible, excell'd all others in pure Seraphick ſtrains, but alas the grave Cheat is at length diſcovered, and though ſome men are very angry, there is no remedy; for heat and ill Language will never retrieve its blaſted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; only the beſt on't is, there is another of the ſame kind, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying his Unhappy Son in his Solitudes and Sufferings too, and thoſe that regret the Diſparagement of the former, may try whether they can ſupport the Credit of the latter; but the World I hope grows too wiſe to be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of ſuch Pageantry.</p>
            <p>The Vindicator affirmed, That it was by the Addreſs and Intereſt of the Party called Presbyterian (under God:) That King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was reſtored, and (he adds) the ſolemn Promiſes, fair Words and great Aſſurances, that were given them by the Church and Court Party, upon the Treaty of Reſtoration, are very well known, and the ſpeedy and bare-faced Violation of all, is not to be parallell'd in Story; which <hi>T. W.</hi> miſreports, as if the Vindicator had ſaid that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd in Story, tho' afterwards, having cleared his Eyes he confeſſes, theſe things are charged upon the Church and Court Party, and how will be bring them off; he ſays, <hi>All is Fiction and Forgery, for the King referr'd all to the Parliament, and they re-eſtabliſhed and Confirmed all things to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Nation in General.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, if we cannot prove theſe things to be true, we will own the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, and ſubmit to all the Reproaches this Gentleman can heap upon us; I would feign know where the Fiction lies. Were there no Promiſes made by the Court and Church Party? or were they not broken? It is ſtrange we ſhould be obliged to prove that ſuch Promiſes were made, when the Kings Declaration ſpeaks it ſo plainly in theſe Words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We do declare a Liberty to tender Conſciences, and that no man ſhall be diſquieted, or called in Queſtion, for differences in Opinion, which do not diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom, and that we ſhall be ready to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch Acts of Parliament, as upon Mature Deliberation, ſhall be of fered to us for the full granting that Indulgence.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:93151:80"/>
            <p>And in his Declaration concerning Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, <hi>Oct.</hi> 25. 1660. he ſaith, <q>When We were in <hi>Holland,</hi> we were attended by many Grave and Learned Miniſters from hence, who were look't upon as the moſt able and principal Aſſertors of the Presbyterian Opinions, and to our great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, we found them Perſons full of Affection towards us, of Zeal for the Peace of the Church and State, and neither Enemies to Epiſcopacy nor Liturgy, but modeſtly to deſire ſuch Alterations in either, as without ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Foundations, might beſt allay the preſent Diſtempers, which the Indiſpoſitions of the times and tenderneſs of ſome mens Conſciences had contracted for the better doing, whereof we did intend to call a Synod, and in the mean time, We publiſhed in our Declaration from <hi>Breda,</hi> a Liberty to tender Conſciences — We need not profeſs the high Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Eſteem, which We have for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law, nor do we think, that Reverence in the leaſt diminiſhed by our Condeſcentions, not peremptorily to inſiſt upon ſome particulars of Ceremony, which however intruduced, by the Piety, and Devotion, and Order, of the former times, may not be ſo agreeable to the preſent, but may even leſſen that Piety and Devotion for the improvement whereof, they might be happily firſt introduced, and conſequently may be well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd with — And We have not the leaſt doubt, but the Biſhops will think the Conceſſions now made by us, juſt and reaſonable, and will cheerfully conform themſelves thereunto — that Kneeling at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſhall not be impoſed, nor the Croſs, nor Surplice, nor any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to the Subſcription, or Oath of Canonical Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Behold the Promiſes that were made, I hope, he would not have us prove that they were not performed; But it ſeems the King left all to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they re-eſtabliſhed matters to ſatisfaction, but this will not prove that theſe Promiſes were not broken, but only that they ſhould not have been made: The King at that time ſeemed willing to have kept his Promiſe, and he had ſome honeſt Counſellors about him that adviſed him to it; and in Order thereunto by his Commiſſion, He authorized divers Learned Perſons of both Perſwaſions to conſult together and agree on ſuch Alterations in the Liturgy as were neceſſary to tender Conſciences.</p>
            <p>The Presbyterian Divines not one Diſſenting, offered to ſubmit to Arch-Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi>'s Primitive Form of Epiſcopacy, and to a ſtated Liturgy, and drew up a moſt excellent One for that purpoſe, which for aptneſs and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Expreſſion, excellent Coherence and Method, and ſuitableneſs to all the Emergencies of humane Life, was incomparably beyond the old one; And when that would not be received, offered ſome amendments of the old one, and would have complied with it; but the Biſhops treated them after a diſdainful, imperious manner, and would yield to nothing for accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Truth of this cannot be doubted by any that have ſeen the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to the King, the Petition for Peace, and Account of the Proceedings of the Commiſſioners at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> which an ingenious Conformiſt having
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93151:80"/>lately read, confeſſed to me, that was a brave Opportunity for Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and he was fully ſatisfied that the after Schiſm lay at the Biſhops door.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is no wonder that Conſultation was ſo unſucceſsful, when it appears the leading men amongſt the Biſhops, were ſo far from intending any ſuch thing as Comprehenſion, that their great deſign in Treating with the other Party was, to know what they would ſtick at, that ſo they might be ſure to ſhut them out; and it is credibly reported that Arch-Biſhop <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> ſhould ſay, now we know their Minds, we'll make them all Knaves if they Conform, and it was a remarkable ſaying of a Reverend Dean (<hi>T. W.</hi> has often heard of) when a ſober Gentleman ſhewed ſome regret that the door was ſo ſtrait that many ſober Miniſters could not have Admiſſion, replyed, <hi>it was no Pitty at all, if we thought ſo many of them would have Conformed, we would have made it ſtraiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Act of Uniformity, which they got in 1661. is juſtly eſteemed the Source and Spring of all that Diſcord, Perſecution, and Diſtraction the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has groaned under for many years, and indeed no better Fruits could be expected from it, if we conſider the ſcandalous Arts that were uſed for the obtaining of it; and though I am weary of Tranſcribing, yet I will inſert that remarkable Story, that Captain <hi>Yarranton</hi> tells us, in His full diſcovery of the firſt Presbyterian Sham-Plot, Printed at <hi>London</hi> for <hi>Francis Smith</hi> near the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> 1681.</p>

               <q>This Sham-Plot was laid in about thirty ſix Counties of <hi>England,</hi> but I
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93151:81"/>ſhall write principally of that part of it which was executed in <hi>Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> the Month of <hi>November</hi> in the Year 1661. Several Letters were drawn up and delivered by Sir <hi>John P</hi>— to one <hi>Richard N</hi>— his Neighbour, to carry to one — <hi>Cole</hi> of <hi>Martly,</hi> about four Miles from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who is now living. This —<hi>Cole</hi> according to Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, delivereth a Pacquet of Letters to one—<hi>Churne</hi> of <hi>Witchinford,</hi> (who alſo is, or lately was alive, and dwelt near <hi>Martly;</hi>) This Pacquet of Letters was carried by <hi>Cole</hi> and <hi>Churne</hi> unto Sir <hi>John P.</hi> (from whom it came) and before him <hi>Churne</hi> makes an Affidavit, That going early in the Morning to his Labour, he ſtruck his Bill upon a Hedge to cut a Thorn, and by and by on the other ſide the Hedge, he ſpyed a Scotch Pedlar, putting up Letters haſtily in his Pack, and being affrighted (as he ſuppoſed) he left that Pacquet behind in the Ditch, and went down a Lane leading to Coll. <hi>John Birch</hi> his Houſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Oath being made, and the Pacquet delivered (as aforeſaid) and opened, <q>it preſently appeared that there was a Conſpiracy on foot to ſtir up Rebellion in the Kingdom, and to raiſe an Army for that purpoſe, and that Capt. <hi>Andrew Tarranton</hi> was to Command a Party in thoſe Parts, for which purpoſe there were ſeveral Letters directed to him from ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and others;
<note place="margin">Who then lived at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                  </note> Particularly, one from Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Kidder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> intimating that he had provided a conſiderable Body of Men, well arm'd, which ſhould be in readineſs againſt the time appointed. Another from Mr. <hi>Ambroſe Sparry,</hi> intimating that he had order'd him 500 <hi>l.</hi> which was lodg'd in a Friends hand (not named) and ſhould be ready for him whenever he ſhould ſend for it; Several other Letters and Treaſonable Papers were pretended to be in that Pacquet, all which occaſioned the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Militia of that County, and the City of <hi>Worceſter</hi> was filled that Night with Horſe and Foot;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 9.</note> Early the next Morning about Two of the Clock, an Officer with a Troop comes to Mr. <hi>Yarranton</hi>'s Houſe, and ſeeing Lights in moſt of the Windows for a Seaſon he made a halt, but anon he drew near the Houſe, and demanded Entrance. Mrs. <hi>Yarranton</hi> told him, ſhe would open the Doors, provided he would come in with no more than two Perſons beſides himſelf, to which he aſſented, and when he was come in, demanded of Mrs. <hi>Yarranton,</hi> where her Huſband was? She anſwered, he was not at Home. The Officer replied, he was at Home the Evening before.

Some of the Party being Voluntiers out of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> obſerving the words and deportment of Mrs. <hi>Yarranton,</hi> went preſently Home again, amongſt whom was Mr. <hi>Winter Hains</hi> an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, and ſince Mayor of the City (and ſtill alive,) who hath often ſaid, that very inſtant he ſmelt the Deſign; The Officer with his Party was brought by <hi>Henry Cowell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Yarranton</hi>'s Servant, to the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:93151:81"/>where finding the ſaid <hi>Yarranton,</hi> the Officer told him, he was his Priſoner, and muſt go along with him to <hi>Worceſter;</hi> and about Ten of the Clock the ſame day they all entred the City, where all the Trained Bands of the County were up in Arms. The ſame day ſeveral other Perſons were ſecured, as Mr. <hi>Ambroſe Sparry</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Martly,</hi> (near which place the Sham-Pacquet was pretended to be found) Mr. <hi>Henry Oſland</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Bewdly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edward Oſland</hi> of the <hi>Rock,</hi> Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> of <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminſter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jarvis Brian</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Old-Swinford,</hi> Capt. <hi>Wells,</hi> (living now at <hi>Bednal-Green</hi>) Mr. <hi>Henry Baldwin,</hi> Mr. <hi>George Wilſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Vicars</hi> (now living in <hi>Smithfield</hi>) Mr. <hi>Mekine,</hi> all four of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> with ſorne Scores more which I for bear to mention; all which Perſons were diſpoſed of into ſeveral Priſons or Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Confinement, ſo that they could not ſpeak one with another, having Sentinels always ſtanding at their ſeveral Doors. Amongſt the common People there was a great noiſe of a Horrid Plot, a Presbyterian Plot, and they were ſo confirmed in the belief of it, that the ſeveral Priſoners as they marched with their Guards through the Streets, were greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled and affronted.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>All things continued in this Poſture for the ſpace of Ten Days, after which time, the Trained Bands would continue no longer, they were grown a little ſenſible of the Sham; and upon their departure, the Deputy-Lieutenants (out of their great Clemency) Diſcharged all the Priſoners then in Cuſtody, (except Dr. <hi>Jackſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sparry,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hen.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Edw. Oſland,</hi> Capt. <hi>Wells,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Yarranton</hi>) only they muſt Pay their Fees, and find good Security not to go five Miles from their Habitations, without leave firſt obtained from the Lord-Lieutenant or two Deputy-Lieutenants, and to appear when they were ſent for, and to keep all the King's Laws Eccleſiaſtical and Civil. This done, Mr. <hi>Sparry,</hi> Dr. <hi>Jackſon,</hi> the two <hi>Oſlands,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Yarranton,</hi> were ordered to be kept cloſe Priſoners in ſeveral Chambers of the <hi>George-Inn</hi> in <hi>Worceſter;</hi> ſo that no Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever muſt come to ſpeak with any of them but in the preſence of the Marſhal. The Trained-Bands being gone, as was ſaid before,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jo.

               </p>
               <p>I cannot omit acquainting you with one renowned Act of Chivalry that was done in this Church-Court-Guard; There came to <hi>Worceſter</hi> a poor Old Man to enquire after the welfare of Mr. <hi>Henry Oſland</hi> his Miniſter,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93151:82"/>and ſpeaking with one of thoſe Soldiers, the Soldier liberally charged Mr. <hi>Oſland</hi> with being a Traitor, a Rebel, a Plotter againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with ſome other hard Names; he ſtoutly defended his Miniſter, and ſaid he was an honeſt peaceable Man, and he could never believe he was concerned in any Treaſon, or Plot againſt the Government; The Church-Militant-man in great Wrath laid hold of this poor old Zealot, and carried him to the Court of Guard: He that then preſided in that Court Marſhal was alſo a Church-Officer, and no meaner Man than an Apparitor; he commanded the Old Man to be tied Neck and Heels, charged him with having a hand in this Presbyterian Plot, and threatned him with ſevere Uſage unleſs he would make a Confeſſion: The Old Man bore all this with a great deal of Patience, anſwering him never a word; which ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged this Man in Authority, that he put lighted Matches betwixt his Fingers, and burnt them to the very Bone, and all to force from him a Confeſſion of a Presbyterian Plot. The Name of the Perſon thus Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured is <hi>Roger Waldern</hi> of <hi>Bewdly,</hi> who for ought I have heard to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is ſtill alive, and carrieth about him the ſhrivelled Skin cauſed by thoſe burning Matches, and ſo are many others alive that ſaw him in his Miſery, and that contributed their help to the healing of his hands.</p>
               <p>This feigned Plot was not only laid in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> but in other Shires and Counties of <hi>England,</hi> as I hinted before, I could fill many Sheets of Paper, if I pleaſed, with particulars; but give me leave to inform you only of ſome Paſſages in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> with reſpect to this Plot, which fell out about the ſame time. There dwelt in <hi>Oxford</hi> one Mr. <hi>Matthew Martin,</hi> who was then Town-Clerk there,
<note place="margin">In <hi>Old-Street, London.</hi>
                  </note> he is now a Brewer in <hi>London,</hi> and in good reputation both for Eſtate and Integrity; There came one Evening to his Houſe in <hi>Oxford,</hi> a Stranger with a Letter, who had no ſooner deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it, but he withdrew and went his away, when Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> had opened it, and a little conſidered the Contents, he took a Prudent Courſe to carry it to the Mayor, as you'll hear by and by, and to do it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; for had he tarried a Night, or an Hour, it might have been found about him, and <hi>Oxford</hi> had quickly been as full or fuller of Plotters and Priſoners than <hi>Worceſter;</hi> The Copy of this Memorable Letter I here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert word for word.</p>

               <p>'Tis high time now that I return to <hi>Worceſter</hi> and give you an Account of the forementioned Plotters in cloſe Confinement there.

<note place="margin">Richard H.</note> On the Second of <hi>April</hi> 1662, the Perſon that was employed (as I have ſhewed you before) to carry the Pacquet of Sham Letters from Sir <hi>J. P.</hi> to one <hi>Cole</hi> of <hi>Martly,</hi> acquaints his Brother how he came by the ſaid Pacquet; his Brother im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon this Diſcovery, repairs to Mrs. <hi>Yarranton</hi> and informs her of it; She went to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and prevails with the Marſhal's Maid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver a Paper to her Husband wherein was a Relation of the whole Matter. This being done, Mr. <hi>Yarranton</hi> peruſed the Paper, and being thereby let into the knowledge of this Malicious Deſign, He ordered ſix Actions to be immediately Entred againſt ſome of thoſe that brought him to Priſon: And the next day being <hi>Saturday,</hi> in the time of high Market, he took two Bedſtaffs in his hands, and broke all the Windows in the Chamber
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93151:83"/>where he was Confined,
<note place="margin">The <hi>George</hi> in the <hi>High-Street.</hi>
                  </note> and which look'd towards the Street; upon which the Town was in an Uproar, and a Multitude of People crowded before the Chamber in the broad Street to know what the matter was! He told them how he and others were maliciouſly and wrongfully Impriſoned; that he could give an Account of the Contrivance of this Plot, and who were the Contrivers of it.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following, the Lord-Lieutenant and Six of his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties came to Town, and ſent one <hi>Fulk Fiſher</hi> (an Officer of theirs) to Mr. <hi>Yarranton</hi> to know the reaſon of his miſ-behaving himſelf in the place of his Confinement: He ſent them word, He did it on purpoſe that he might be brought the ſooner before them, to make a Diſcovery of the Presbyterian Plot ſo much talk'd of, which he was ready and willing to do. After ſome debate between the Lord-Lieutenant and his Deputies about this Matter, it was at laſt reſolved that <hi>Yarranton</hi> ſhould be brought before them, which was done; There he offered to diſcover to them the whole Plot how it was laid, and by whom and for what Ends; he deſired that the Doors might be ſet open, for he had many Friends and Witneſſes without; He prayed alſo that he might have Pen, Ink and Paper, and he would write down the whole Matter; for words might be wreſted to wrong intents: This was a while debated, but in reaſon it could not be denied, and Mr. <hi>Yarranton</hi> no ſooner began to write, but the Lord-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and Sir <hi>John P.</hi> left the Room, and went down the Back Stairs, and after followed the reſt of the Deputy-Lieutenants, only Eſq <hi>Bromely</hi> of <hi>Holt</hi> ſtaid behind. He it ſeems was no way Privy to this Deſign, and told Mr. <hi>Yarranton,</hi> he was Sorry with all his heart to ſee ſuch things pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, to the diſturbance of Honeſt Men, and the diſhonour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>The Enemy having thus fairly quitted the Field, Mr. <hi>Yarranton</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Martial, What he had further now to ſay to him? The Marſhal only made it his Requeſt, that he would not trouble him for holding him ſo long in Reſtraint, foraſmuch as he was a Poor Man, and had many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and did only follow the Orders of his Superiours in what he had done. Mr. <hi>Yarranton</hi> told him, He did freely forgive him.</p>
               <p>Theſe dangerous Plotters being now at Liberty, they depart every Man to his own Home, and were never proſecuted or further queſtioned about this Matter: There was no need of that, for the Contrivers had now obtained their End, which was to poſſeſs the King and Parliament, that it was abſolutely neceſſary to make ſome ſevere Act againſt this reſtleſs ſort of Men, who not contented with the King's Gracious Pardon, were always Plotting to diſturb the Government: Accordingly when the Parliament met together upon the 20th of <hi>November</hi> 1661.

<note place="margin">Some of the Ejected Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters had been Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers for the King, as Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kirby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Seddan,</hi> ſent up Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners about Sir <hi>Geo.

An honourable Member of the Houſe of Commons obſerved in Parliament in the Year 1680. If the Laws againſt Diſſenters were projected in favour of the Proteſtant Religion, it is ſtrange they were ſo promoted (as many Members now here, that Served in that Parliament do remember) by Sir <hi>Thomas Clifford,</hi> Sir <hi>Solomon Swale</hi> and Sir <hi>Roger Strickland,</hi> who have all ſince appeared to be Papiſts.</p>
            <p>When the lamentable Effects of this Act began to appear more viſible every day than other, and the King was ſenſible how they had been cheated into it, by a pretended Plot, the Forgery whereof was now diſcovered; He ſet forth the very ſame Year <hi>Decem.</hi> 26. his Declaration of Indulgence, and in <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> next when the Parliament was met,

            <p>In the Year 1665. That dreadful Plague in <hi>London</hi> drove a great many Miniſters out of the City, and left open a Door for ſome Nonconformiſts to Preach in their Pulpits; and Men being a little ſtartled and their Spirits ſoftened by that Stupendious Judgment of God, there was a Connivance, and Private Meetings were ſet up and multiplied greatly.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1667. The King in his Speech to both Houſes of Parliament <hi>Die Lunae,</hi> 10 <hi>die Febr.</hi> thus expreſs'd himſelf—<q>One thing more I hold my ſelf obliged to recommend unto you at this preſent; which is, That you would ſeriouſly think of ſome Courſe to beget a better Union and Compoſure in the Minds of my Proteſtant Subjects in Matters of Religion, whereby they may be induced not only to ſubmit quietly to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo chearfully give their Aſſiſtance to the Support of it.</q> But there was nothing done at that time towards it.</p>
            <p>In 1672. The King again gives Liberty of Conſcience, upon what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, Conjectures were various; many believed it to be in favour of Popery, but others ſaid the Papiſts had as much Liberty before, being generally winked at, and the Penal Laws wholly turn'd upon Proteſtant Diſſenters; However the Houſe of Commons took notice of it, and would not allow the King any Power to Diſpenſe with the Laws, and yet were grown ſo ſenſible of the Hardſhips put upon Diſſenting Proteſtants, that a Bill was brought in, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of them and paſſed the Houſe, and was ſent up to the Houſe of Lords, and it is verily believed had paſſed them too, but for want of time.</p>
            <p>In 1675. The Parliament met again, in which the Church and Court Party laid aſide their Zeal againſt Popery, and all the Cry was againſt Diſſenters; and a Bill that was Voted in the former Seſſion, for Marrying our Princes only to Proteſtants, was carried in the Negative by the Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Vote of the Biſhops Bench and rejected; And a Teſt brought in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring all Officers in Church and State, and all Members of both Houſes to take this following Oath.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> A.

            <p>But all was in vain, for (ſays our Honourable Author) the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea</hi> put an End to the Debate, and the Major Vote <hi>Ultima ratio Senatuum &amp; Conciliorum</hi> carried the Queſtion as the Court and Biſhops would have it, and all they could do was to enter their Proteſts againſt it, and were mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>And thus with Wind and Tide our Church-men bore down furiouſly upon the Diſſenters, and all that durſt but ſeem favourable to them, for two or three Years together, till the Popiſh Plot broke out in 1678. which gave ſuch an Alarm to the Nation, as reduced ſome Men to their Wits, and others to their Wits-end; Now the Humour was diverted another way, and a year or two ſpent in ſearching into the depth of the Deſign, and while ſome zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were diligently employed in tracing out the Plot; others that called themſelves by the ſame Name, were as buſie by their Counter-mines and Counter-paces to ſpoil the track and make it undiſcernable.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Diſſenters were pretty eaſie, the Meetings encreaſed and were greatly frequented; And there being now a Parliament of true Engliſhmen, they ordered a Bill to be brought into the Houſe of Commons for the Uniting of Proteſtants, and in their Journals we have this Reſolve, <hi>That it is the Opinion of this Houſe, that the Proſecution of Diſſenters upon the Penal Laws, is at this time grievous to the Subject, a weakning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Interest, an Encouragement to Popery, and Dangerous to the Peace of this Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as the Plot died, Perſecution revived; New Sham-plots were forged and faſtened upon Presbyterians: Then was our Land ſtained with the No,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93151:85"/>bleſt and moſt Innocent Blood of <hi>Eſſex, Ruſſel, Sidney, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe invaluable Lives were ſacrificed to the Luſts of Papiſts and Tories, whilſt Eccleſiaſticks ſung <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and the injured Nation durſt ſcarcely be ſeen to lament their fall.</p>
            <p>When the Duke of <hi>York</hi> arrived at the Crown, the Stream of Perſecution was very ſtrong and violent, and all men thought the unhappy attempt of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> would have made it rage more furiouſly when almoſt all the Gentlemen in <hi>England</hi> that were counted Whiggs were under Confinement; but not long after a Declaration was ſet forth for a General Liberty of Conſcience; I am ſure it was unexpected by the generality of Diſſenters; it found ſome of them in Priſon, and like a good Angel made their fetters fall off, and the doors fly open; others were forced to abſcond from their Families, and Employments, for fear of the Excommunication Writ, and theſe it reſcued from impending ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; and indeed it found them all inſulted over, ſcorned and trampled upon by the Bigots of the other Party, but this Declaration put a reſpect upon them, and gave them the Opportunity of letting the World ſee they were neither ſo few, nor ſo bad, nor contemptible as their Adverſaries had repreſented them.</p>
            <p>There are two things for which Diſſenters are frequently reproached in the late Reign. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Their accepting that Liberty with ſuch Addreſſes of Thanks. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their writing ſo few Books againſt Popery; I have ſomething to ſay in their juſt Defence upon both Accounts.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> It had been the greateſt Madneſs in the World for them, to have refuſed the Advantages of that Liberty; they thought themſelves obliged to Worſhip God according to the Dictates of their Conſciences, when they run the Riſque of Priſons, and Baniſhment for ſo doing; and to neglect it, when they were freed from thoſe hazards, would have been ſuch a piece of ſullen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable perverſneſs, as theſe Gentlemen would ſoon have upbraided us with. I know it is commonly ſaid, that Toleration was promoted in favour of the Papiſts, and I believe few of the Diſſenters ever queſtioned it; but they knew very well, that when it was granted, for them to have ſate ſtill, and ſuffer'd the Papiſts alone to enjoy the Benefits of it, would have ſtrengthed Popery much more; the Papiſts would have had never the leſs Liberty, though Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had been ſilent, and when they were let looſe, it was time for all hands to be at work, to countermine them, and there's no better weapon to ſubdue Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, than the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</p>
            <p>It is objected, this Declaration was founded upon a Diſpenſing Power and to accept of it was owning ſuch a Power; But the Diſſenters never by Word or Writing aſcribed any ſuch Power unto the King as to Diſpenſe with the Laws, that are for the good of the Nation; indeed they always eſteemed the Laws by which they were excluded to be very unjuſt and unreaſonable Edicts, contrary to the Law of God, and the common Intereſt, and that they ought not to have been made, or ever executed when they were made, they never thought them binding in Point of Conſcience, and though they were forced heretofore to ſubmit to the Penalty, yet they were not ſo forſaken of common Sence, as to court the Continuance of that Penalty, or caſt themſelves into Priſon, when the Magiſtrate did not think fit to do it.</p>
            <pb n="154" facs="tcp:93151:86"/>
            <p>But the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> had often in the Pulpit, and from the Preſs told the King that he had ſuch a Power, as the Author of <hi>Vox Cleri pro Rege,</hi> ſhews us in abundance of Inſtances. And the Judges who were of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> had given it for Law, as the other had declared it for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and all the Magiſtrates in <hi>England</hi> thought fit to acquieſce in it, which ſurely they would not have done, if they had not thought it a juſt and reaſonable thing; for indeed the Kings Declaration would have ſignified little, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates had put the Laws in Execution ſtill; and if they did not think thoſe Laws were really ſuſpended, they were bound by their Oaths to have done it, and their forbearance was a plain acknowledgment of ſuch a Power at leaſt, as to ſuch kind of Laws, as were hereby ſuſpended, but the Diſſenters, only perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to do that which they thought themſelves obliged to (as they had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity) by the Law of God, any thing in humane Laws to the Contrary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.</p>
            <p>And as to their Addreſſes of Thanks, it leaſt becomes the Churchmen of all others to Reflect upon them, not only becauſe it was their Cruelty that made Indulgence ſo very pleaſant, and Oppreſſion ſometimes makes a wiſe man mad, but alſo becauſe they fall vaſtly ſhort of thoſe high flights of Complement, which theſe men themſelves took in their Addreſſes of a far worſe Nature and Occaſion. If it be ſo Criminal to Thank the King, for not ſuffering Proteſtants to deſtroy one another, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe that in the moſt Luxuriant manner, thank'd him for diſſolving one of the beſt of Parliaments,
<note place="margin">E. of <hi>W</hi>'s Speech.</note> and as a Noble Peer lately told them, <q>Were ſo forward in the Surrender of Charters, and their fulſom Addreſſes and Abhorrences, making no other claim to their Liberties and Civil Rights but Conceſſions from the Crown, telling the King every one of his Commands was ſtamp'd with Gods Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Beſides, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by one of thoſe that joined in an Addreſs of Thanks to the King in <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> that the Nonconformiſts never moved in it till the Churchmen had led them the way; theſe Gentleman therefore are too Imprudent to provoke us to Recriminations that will be ſo vaſtly to their own diſhonour; I am ſure the Diſſenters thank'd the Late King for nothing, but what our preſent King and Parliament have Confirmed to them, as the likelieſt way to unite Proteſtants in Intereſt and Affection, as the Preamble of the Act ſpeaks; and if there was any thing in that Liberty that was ſerviceable to the Papiſts, it muſt be in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of giving it, not in the thing it ſelf, as far as we are concerned in it; and if the Epiſcopal Party had been ſo wiſe as to have promoted a legal Comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when it was in their Power they had diſabled the Papiſts from ſerving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of any Liberty of ours.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Second,</hi> That Diſſenters writ ſo little againſt Popery in the Late Reign, it may be very eaſily accounted for.</p>
            <p>They have ſufficiently demonſtrated their Abhorrence of Popery at all times, and their Leading Men, as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> and the Preachers of the Morning Lecture, have acquitted themſelves very well in the Confutation of it; and Malice it ſelf cannot really believe that they are in the leaſt favourable to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93151:86"/>the Romiſh Hereſie, the Crime that has been generally objected againſt them, has been their too great averſation and diſtance from it.</p>
            <p>As for the late Diſcourſes upon that Subject, that are ſo much boaſted of, it is obſervable that moſt of them were begun upon Perſonal Engagements,
<note place="margin">The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Exam. of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> by Catholick Tradition.</note> as one of the Principal Managers thereof acknowledges; <hi>There is (ſays he) a Train in Controverſies as well as in Thoughts, one thing ſtill giving ſtart to another, Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences produce Letters, Letters, Books, and one diſcourſe gives occaſion for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. Now in ſuch Caſes it would not been have decent, for a Third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have ſtept in and invaded another mans Province.</p>
            <p>Beſides there was no manner of Neceſſity for it, the Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> have been a baffled party for ſome Ages, and their Errors ſo often expoſed that it was too eaſie a Task theſe Gentlemen were engaged in, to require ſo much help, it's a beaten Road in which they were to Travel; and as I do not find that the Papiſts offered any thing of late, but what has been in ſubſtance anſwered a thouſand times, ſo it was not neceſſary for our Doctors, to ſet their Wits on the Rack for a Reply, not indeed do I perceive any thing, Method and Language excepted, that pretends to be new; nor is this any Diminution of their Honour, but a Peace of Juſtice to the Memory, and worth of thoſe that have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
            <p>And I might add,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fuller C. H.</hi> l. 9. p. 74. This clauſe was left out of the Art. in 1571, but A. B <hi>Land,</hi> would have it inſerted again. <hi>Parker, Cartwright, Walker, Boyes, Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Slater, Manby, Good all,</hi> &amp;c.</note> the Presbyterians had little Reaſon to fear that any of their Perſwaſion would be perverted, their diſtinguiſhing Principle of the ſufficiency of the Scripture, will infallibly ſecure them, whilſt they adhere unto it; But many of our Churchmen had inſtill'd into their Followers very odd Notions <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Power of the Church in Matters of Faith, (as in the twenty Article) and of the Apoſtolical Succeſſion and Authority of Biſhops, and their Power of Judging what is fit and decent in the Worſhip of God to which all others muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and concerning the binding force of old Canons and Councils;</hi> and ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as theſe would be in danger to betray men into the Arms of that Church, that can pretend as high in theſe matters as any; and it is certain in Fact ſome of their Biſhops and Doctors and Clergy fell in with them, and it was time for them to beſtir themſelves, to deliver their men out of the Snares which they had helped to lay for them.</p>
            <p>And the Diſſenters were very well pleaſed to ſee thoſe Learned Men baffling the Papiſts, upon ſuch Principles, as they had reaſon to hope, would ſet the Authors themſelves more upright, than before ſome of them had been; thoſe that read Dr. <hi>Sherlocks</hi> Preſervatives againſt Popery, and what he there ſays concerning the Nature of Goſpel Worſhip, <hi>That God will not now have a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor is his Preſence appropriated to any place, and the like,</hi> and compare it with that he has formerly writ, eſpecially in that Book wherein he told us,
<note place="margin">Vind. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> p. 13.</note> 
               <hi>that Chriſtianity is nothing elſe but Myſtical Judaiſm,</hi> will find that his late Polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Engagements, were ſo very beneficial to himſelf that it had been a thouſand pitties, to have taken the work out of his Hands; And what I have collected out of theſe Modern debates concerning Church-Unity, Communion, Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may convince any man that we had all the reaſon in the World, to

            <p>The Author of the Review takes upon him to affirm, that <hi>none of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, endeavoured at that time to fortifie his Conventicle againſt Popiſh Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but how can he expect to be believed in that, which 'tis as impoſſible for him to know, as to be an Ubiquitarian, and in all the Conventicles in <hi>England</hi> at the ſame time, and as he can never prove it to be true, ſo there are thouſands in <hi>England</hi> know it to be falſe, and are able to teſtifie, that notwithſtanding their Obligations to the Government, their Miniſters never failed, to confute Popiſh Tenets, when they fell in their way, and that not ſeldom they would go a ſtep or two out of their way to meet them.</p>
            <p>As unhappy is he, in the little ſtories that follow, <hi>Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>was in Fee with King</hi> James, and yet was dead, ſeveral years before; <hi>Our preſent Patrons were the men pickt up at Court to compleat our Ruine;</hi> and yet I know of no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons we have for our Liberty, but the King, Lords and Commons, I hope he does not mean them. We know very well what Biſhops and others were of the Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion, in the Biſhop of <hi>Londons</hi> Caſe, and in that of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Maudlin</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford;</hi> not one Presbyterian amongſt them. Let this Gentleman prove, that any Miniſters of ours aſſiſted at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical Intreagues, or had Mony ſprinkled amongſt them to carry on thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and by my Conſent, whoever is found Guilty ſhall be his Bondſlave, but by no means let Confidence, and Noiſe, and loud Appeals be taken for Evidence againſt them.</p>
            <p>Amongſt all that Croud of Writers, that give us the Hiſtory of the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, there is ſcarcely one of them, but acknowledges that the Diſſenters, were aware of the Popiſh deſign of taking away the Teſt, and would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it; though for the Penal Laws, they thought many of them might be very well ſpared; and I challenge him to prove that either Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> or any other Perſon amongſt thoſe called Presbyterian and Congregational (and we have nothing to do with others) ever adviſed King <hi>James</hi> to any thing, but what our Preſent King and Parliament, have thought fit to eſtabliſh by Law:</p>
            <p>If (as this Gentleman tells us) a little Money,
<note place="margin">Review, <hi>p.</hi> 33.</note> and a Toleration will make the Diſſenters ſo eaſie and quiet, and well ſatisfied; it is a ſign they are not the worſt tempered People in the World; and it were well if our Churchmen were as eaſily pleaſed, for what my Lord <hi>Falkland</hi> (a great Royaliſt) ſaid of ſome of the Biſhops in 1641, they were ſo cordially Papiſts, that it was all that fifteen hundred Pounds a Year could do to keep from Confeſſing it; I am afraid is too true concerning many of our Clergy in another reſpect, it is as much as ſome hundreds a year can do to keep them Quiet, and Content under the preſent Government.</p>
            <p>However we are obliged to him for telling us, what the ſober thinking Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple judge of us, it ſeems, <hi>They do not ſtick to ſay, that our Zeal againſt Popery
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93151:87"/>is all Counterfeit, that we would be better Conformiſts if Popery ſhould prevail than we are now;</hi> but he ſhould have told us, who theſe ſober thinking Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are, for many will preſume to dignifie themſelves with thoſe Epithets,
<note place="margin">See the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> that have as little right to 'em, as any People in the World; and it is uſual enough, for a Mob of Eccleſiaſtical Politico's to get together, and when they are well heated with drinking Healths to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and have liberally Curſed and Damned the Diſſenters, then ſtep forth, and look big, and think themſelves capable of reporting the opinion of all the ſober thinking men of the Nation; and I am the more inclin'd to believe that it is a Cabal of ſuch men as theſe, that have choſen this Gentleman for their Speaker, becauſe our own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience aſſures us, thoſe Conformiſts that are really moſt ſober, have always expreſt far different Sentiments concerning us, and we hope we ſhall never do any thing to forfeit their Friendly reſpect, but be always as ready to return, as receive it.</p>
            <p>I muſt not omit, what this Gentleman has replyed to the Vindicator concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Penal Laws, as they have been executed upon Proteſtant Diſſenters; He pretends, <hi>they reclaimed many, and did a great deal towards bringing Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Proteſtants to Uniformity,</hi> it was well he did not ſay to Unity, for that had been one of the groſſeſt Fallacies in the World; And I will not deny but that many Diſſenters went to Church, when they had no where elſe to go, their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters being ſome in Priſon, others beyond Sea, and many not daring to ſhew their Heads, and perhaps ſome of them were forced, by thoſe ſevere Proceedings to comply further than their Conſciences could well allow, and ſuch kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions the French Dragoons may boaſt of too, but it is nevertheleſs certain that theſe things tend to alienate the Minds of Men one from another, and the preſent numbers of Diſſenters, may convince him ſuch Methods will never ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a general Unity; and it was ſome years ago obſerved in Parliament, by an Honourable Perſon. <q>That neither the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act,
<note place="margin">1680. Coll. of Debates. <hi>p.</hi> 211.</note> nor that of the thirty fifth of the Queen, nor any other had ever been executed in favour of the Church, that Diſſenters were as many if not more than ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> will tell this Gentleman,
<note place="margin">Charge in his Primary Viſitation, <hi>p.</hi> 25, 26.</note> 
               <q>That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and too great ſtiffneſs of behaviour towards Diſſenters, have made ſome of them more their Enemies than they would have been; That Perſecution was a Popular Argument for them, the Complaining ſide having always the moſt pitty, but now that is taken off (ſays he) you may deal with them upon more equal Terms; Some think Severity makes men conſider, I am afraid it heats them too much, and makes them too violent and refractory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That this Gentleman may ſee, that not the Vindicator only, but the moſt eminent Fathers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> condemn the Severities that have been uſed towards Proteſtant Diſſenters, and how unbecoming as well as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent a thing it is in him to juſtifie them, I ſhall leave their own Words to his Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The preſent Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who Honours the Metropolitane See, more than he can be honoured by it, in a Faſt Sermon before the Queen,
<note place="margin">Sept. 16, 1691.</note> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Clergy expreſſes himſelf thus. <q>And it can never be ſufficiently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93151:88"/>no though it were with Tears of Blood, that we whoſe particular Charge and Imployment it is to build up the Souls of men in a Holy Faith, and in the Reſolution of a good Life, ſhould for want of due Inſtruction, and by the Diſſolute and Profligate Lives of too many amongſt us, and by inflaming our needleſs differences about leſſer things, have ſo great a hand in the pulling down Religion and in betraying the Souls of men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> in his <hi>Viſliation Charge,</hi> acknowledges that the Perſecution of Diſſenters, was promoted by the Papiſts, his Words are; <q>I hope they are now convinced, that the Perſecution which they complained lately ſo much of, was carried on by other men and for other deſigns than they would then ſeem to believe.</q> Indeed we always thought the Papiſts had the chief hand in it, and we are glad, others begin to ſee it.</p>
            <p>None has ſpoke more freely to this matter than the Biſhop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> in his Obſervations upon <hi>Ridleys</hi> Letter to <hi>Hooper,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 4.</note> he puts this Objection. <q>But when the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſaw that good and great Men and the glorious Martyrs of Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch as <hi>Hooper</hi> was, were offended with theſe Ceremonies, they ſhould have uſed their utmoſt endeavours, to have gotten them diſcharged by Law, as they were impos'd by Law, and not have left them to remain, as a ſtanding offence, and a perpetual ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block to all others of <hi>Hoopers</hi> mind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now to this he Anſwers: <q>This I confeſs would be an Objection very much to the Prejudice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> could it not be truly ſaid, that the Clergy did heartily endeavour to procure this eaſe to ſcrupulous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, though without ſucceſs, for all the eminent Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time did labour in this Point, and could not prevail with the Queen to Conſent to it.</q> And a little further blaming the Nonconformiſts, for cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſo much of Perſecution, excuſes it thus. <q>If any man take my right hand, and therewith bruiſe and batter my left hand; is my right hand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore become a Perſecutor? Is it not really perſecuted as well as the other? and has it not a fellow-feeling and ſhare of the Miſery?</q>
            </p>
            <p>and in his Exhortation to Peace and Union, <q>God be thanked for it that there is an End put to all Perſecution in matters of Religion,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 27.</note> and that the firſt and chief right of Humane Nature, of following the dictates of Conſcience in the Service of God is ſecured to all men amongſt us, and that we are freed I hope for ever, of all the Remnants of the worſt part of Popery, I mean the Spirit of Perſecution.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Seven Biſhops, in their Petition to the late King, declared they would not be wanting in due Tenderneſs to Diſſenters, but willingly come to ſuch a temper as ſhould be thought fit when the matter ſhould come to be conſidered and ſettled in Parliament and Convocation; and about the time of the P. of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Landing, all their diſcourſe was of Union &amp; Comprehenſion; inſomuch as that a Reverend Prelate told a diſſenting Miniſter, <hi>He need never to fear Perſecution from the Church of</hi> England <hi>again;</hi> adding, <hi>If any ſuch thing ſhould ever happen, let me be accounted a falſe Prephet.</hi> I hope theſe Gentlemen will not give us occaſion to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93151:88"/>ſay as <hi>Demades</hi> the Orator was wont to ſay of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> That they never came to conſult of Peace <hi>(niſi atrati)</hi> but in Mourning under ſome Publick Calamity or Danger.</p>
            <p>Our gracious Soveraign, when P. of <hi>Orange,</hi> in his Declaration. promiſed to endeavour a good Agreement between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and all Proteſtant Diſſenters, and to cover and ſecure all thoſe who would live peaceably under the Government, from all perſecution upon the account of their Religion, and has all along ſtrictly adhered to that Royal Promiſe and Deſign; and in purſuance thereof, encircled with his Lords and Commons in Parliament, has given us our preſent Indulgence, as that which the Wiſdom of the Nation judged the likelieſt way to Unite us all in Intereſt and Affection; and I hope the Sentiments of all theſe will more than ballance what our Gentleman has offered to Vindicate the Execution of the Penal Laws, and he muſt be a man of more than ordinary aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that durſt take upon him to oppoſe his private peeviſh opinion to ſuch an auguſt and venerable Determination.</p>
            <p>This Gent. as well as <hi>T. W.</hi> threatens the Vindicator, with I know not what rebukes from the Government, for reflecting upon the Doctrines of Non-Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Paſſive Obedience; but this is a Subject that has been ſo throughly canvaſs'd of late, and the Folly of thoſe Opinions (in the ſence they have been advanced) laid open, that he needs not any one ſhould defend him therein.</p>
            <p>The Honourable Sir <hi>Robert Howard</hi> in his Defence of Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>Jovian,</hi> takes notice of the ſame thing objected againſt him; His Adverſary had ſaid, <hi>I know not how theſe Arguments againſt Non-Reſiſtance and Paſſive Obedience can make for their Majeſties Service, and the honour of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it's poſſible the Noble Author doth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which Sir <hi>Robert</hi> Anſwers, <q>I think I do, and ſhall endeavour to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it; But firſt give me leave to be a little ſurprized that Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> or his Friend, ſhould be concerned for His Majeſty's Service, or the Safety, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Government which Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> renounces: And though it ſeems he could not with a ſafe Conſcience officiate in his Calling under an unlawful Power, made ſo by virtue of the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience; yet, he ſays, he underſtands not how the Oppoſition to this Doctrine can be for the Service of the Government; this is a ſtrange Riddle that the Doctrine of Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, made Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> againſt the Government, and yet he underſtands not how the Oppoſition to that Government can be for the Service of it.—I ſhall readily confeſs, that the Principles I aſſert are for the Safety of one of Dr. <hi>Hick</hi>'s his complicated Tyrants, but they may be for a good Prince that oppoſeth Tyranny. It was againſt theſe Principles (of Paſſive Obedience) that the Nation implored and obtained Relief, and according to their Original Right fixt the Crown upon their Reliever's Head—Then he gives an Excellent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the preſent Government and Rights of the Subject; and concludes, I hope by this Account, I have ſhewed my Adverſary, that the Safety and Honour of this Government was procured and founded againſt his Principles of Paſſive Obedience, which had they been as Sacredly obſerved as he would
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93151:89"/>have them, our Redemption had never been effected, and perhaps he had been better pleaſed— 'tis this true Underſtanding and undivided Intereſt of the King and People that muſt Secure and Preſerve the Honour and Safety of the Government, and the ſhaking of both muſt proceed from the Temptation and Apprehenſion that Paſſive Obedience and the Imperial Law muſt infuſe into the King and People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two Pampleteers would gladly poſſeſs the Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s of our Governours with Indignation againſt the Vindicator, becauſe he made bold to reflect upon the Miſcarriages of our former Princes; when the Citizen forced him to ſay what he did in defence of himſelf and his Friends, whom the other had abuſed by falſly reporting Matters of Fact; for my part, I take no delight in diſturbing the Aſhes of the Dead, much leſs thoſe of Princes, but when ſuch kind of Men as theſe have ruined them by their Flatteries and infatuated Counſels, and would then caſt the Odium of all upon thoſe that are Innocent, it becomes abſolutely neceſſary to declare the Naked Truth, let it fall where it will.</p>
            <p>And as our Preſent Illuſtrious Princes are too Juſt and Righteous in every thing to fear any future Reflections, ſo they are too Wiſe and Generous to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd againſt thoſe that lay open the Faults of ſuch as have gone before, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance whereof is an excellent foyl, to ſet off the unſpotted brightneſs of their own Adminiſtrations;
<note place="margin">Works of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>p.</hi> 206. 1692.</note> and it is a remarkable Paſſage which <hi>De la Croſe</hi> gives us in his Abſtracts, and fit to be here inſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>I remember a wiſe Saying of her Preſent Majeſty, which I was told four or five Years ago by a Reverend Divine who was then preſent; Some would have incenſed her Royal Highneſs againſt that famous French Miniſter Monſieur <hi>Jurieu,</hi> who in his Anſwer to Father <hi>Maimbourg,</hi> that he might the better juſtifie the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> made a very black repreſentation of their Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Is it not a ſhame, ſaid one of the Company, that this Man without any Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration for your Royal Perſon, ſhould dare to throw ſuch Infamous Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies upon a Queen from whom your Royal Highneſs is Deſcended? No, not at all, replied the Ingenious Princeſs; for is it not enough, that by fulſom Praiſes Kings be lulled aſleep all their lives; But muſt Flattery accompany them to their very Graves? How then ſhould Princes fear the Judgment of Poſterity, if Hiſtorians were not allowed to ſpeak the Truth after their Death?</q>
            </p>
            <p>We can never thank God ſufficiently, for giving us Rulers that love plain dealing, and ſcorn to be flattered; and were it not ſo, the truth might be ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and the Nation impoſed upon by theſe Men, as it has been heretofore; they muſt not expect that our Princes will ſo undervalue themſelves as to be the Executioners of every little Menace of their own; the Royal Lyon will not devour all that the waſpiſh Jackcalls have mark'd out for a Prey: If one party Accuſe, the other ſhall have liberty to make their Defence; though it would be moſt pleaſing to our Superiours, that there might be a mutual forbearance and agreement on both Sides.</p>
